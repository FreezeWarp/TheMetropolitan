<p>According to sources, Student Senate had its constituents in mind when it spent five hours debating what sort of food they ought to order for their meetings, and which caterers are worth Metro’s money. “It was a totally necessary conversation, and couldn’t have been handled in a committee or at any other time,” said a source close to the Senate. “It was wildly appropriate to devote five hours to the ever-pressing issue of shoveling grub into our empty stomachs.”</p>
<p>Moreover, it was not the smallest bit asinine that this governing body and committee (which approved the cutting of student organization budgets in half and has stressed the need for student organizations to cut back on food at their meetings and events) should go to such lengths to ensure the proper pizza toppings are selected for future meetings. Nope. Not even the smallest bit ridiculous.</p>
<p>A motion to purchase feed bags for all Metro State student organizations narrowly passed, after Senate members cited the potential savings on paper plates.</p>
<p>There was not a reporter retching in the gallery during the entire discussion, according to sources.</p>
