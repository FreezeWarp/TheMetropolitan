<p>As constituents of Metro State, we are incredibly lucky to have an expedient, versatile and, above all else, relevant means of mass communication between the administration, the various departments and students. That’s why OrgSync is such an effective tool and our email system is a defining model in Minnesota academia.</p>
<p><em>*Editor’s Note: The above statement is not true.</em></p>
<p>It’s honestly a little too easy to make fun of the mass communication models Metro State has adopted in recent years. The university isn’t like other schools in the Twin Cities; we have no centralized campus or on-site residency. There isn’t even necessarily an accessible mode of communication throughout the University. For some, this issue is merely annoying. For others, it’s a deal breaker. “I’ll get emails from the university on a weekly basis,” said Allison Chalmers, a student from Brooklyn Park. “But, if I don’t check it on a daily basis, I’ll miss day-of news.”</p>
<p>“A lot of times, the school will send me information that just doesn’t pertain to me,” said Jonathan Hues, a student from St. Paul. Talk to any student, and they probably share the sentiment. </p>
<p>The University’s success is ultimately a student-driven endeavor. It is the students that create change on campus, and, in this case, the students can and should strive to be heard on what information is important to them. </p>
<p>Amidst jokes of a stagnant OrgSync, and complaints of an email system that is too often leaned upon, is an undoubted truth: this college is most effective when making job and internship opportunities available. The often callous banter overlooks that education philosophy. </p>
<p>After all, Fred Carpenter, head of the Technical Communication and Professional Writing program, sends a more-than-healthy number of emails every week. Carpenter typically sends internship opportunities to those who are a part of her college. This is just one example of a necessary service.</p>
<p>But it’s understandable why students often feel frustrated or annoyed at Metro State’s communication system. OrgSync is a closed environment, many students don’t know what it is until months after enrollment. The email system, while it is often the source of valuable information, can seem ham-handed in its approach. The means of communication need to be opened up for improvement.</p>
<p>This is a challenge to the departments, administration and students of Metro State to begin a conversation about finding a more effective means of communication. While having this conversation, we should keep in mind the unique culture Metro State possesses and the unique issues with which the school is presented. One of the many things Kevin Franken’s recent “History of Metro” series in The Metropolitan has shown is that Metro State has an unconventional and indomitable spirit of determination to progress, grow and improve.</p>
