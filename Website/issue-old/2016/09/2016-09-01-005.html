<p>How do you feel right now? Is your mood good or bad? Are you energetic or tired? Is your mind focused or distracted? Do you experience anxiety or calmness? These are important questions, but we rarely take enough time to consider their importance. We may be too busy to ponder our health or take more steps toward a better well-being. What could happen if someone introduced you to a healthier lifestyle?</p>
<p>The Nursing Students Organization (NSO) works hard to bring health awareness to Metropolitan State University, collaborating with organizations on-campus and in the community to promote wellness. Their events give students new insights into improving their liveliness. Last June, they held an Ayurveda Seminar. Ayurveda is an ancient Indian method of natural healing, whose practitioners believe in the principle of balance. If people are balanced, they will show positive behavioral traits such as cheerfulness, high energy, friendliness and discipline. If people are unbalanced, they exhibit negative behaviors such as anxiety, insomnia, irritability and difficulty focusing. Ayurveda instructors help others discover the benefits of diet, herbs, aromatherapy, massage, music and meditation.</p>
<p>This summer seminar featured Tanya Boigenzahn Sowards – a Reiki Master – of Thai Yoga Bodywork. Experts such as Sowards teach many healing methods and, with their guidance, people acquire natural ways to restore their vitality. They can apply these remedies at home to respond to stress and feel better.</p>
<p>The Ayurveda Seminar is just one example of the programs the NSO brings to Metropolitan State University. Last February, the NSO co-hosted a Valentine’s Day blood drive with the Red Cross. Donating blood saves lives. One person that donates helps at least three individuals! Mari Bjerstedt, the NSO treasurer, reported that they collected 14 units of blood to help this cause. Donators also received a free mini checkup at the blood drive. The assessment measured pulse rate, blood pressure, body temperature and hemoglobin level, giving people a better sense of their personal health. The NSO also provided blood pressure screenings at this year’s spring health expo.</p>
<p>Later this semester, the NSO will bring back one of their most popular events—the Fall Self-Care Event. This gathering usually takes place before final exam week. “Last year, vendors provided back massages, Reiki, hand massages and aromatherapy for attendees; lunch and refreshments were also provided. This event gave Metro State students an opportunity to take a break, regroup, and receive a moment of relaxation before beginning the fall finals week. Free raffle tickets were given at each station to help facilitate movement through the event,” said NSO President, Margaret Olatunbosun.</p>
<p>You do not need to be a nursing student to participate in NSO activities; the organization invites all students and staff to their events. Also, students not in the nursing program can join the NSO. To become a member, you need to volunteer for events and attend meetings. Besides learning about health, you can gather valuable skills for your field of study.</p>
<p>The officers of the NSO are Margaret Olatunbosun (president), Kelli Gerards (vice president), Mari Bjerstedt (treasurer), and Yeng Lee (secretary).
