<p>Have you ever spent too much time at the library or computer lab? Perhaps it was “crunch time” and you were preparing for an exam or writing a major paper. Did your head feel like it was ready to explode? If you ever feel like this, it may be time for a break. Rest could help you replenish your mind’s energy and restore focus. It can also help you regain your productivity.</p>
<p>While studying at the Metropolitan State University library, take a moment to visit the David Barton Community Labyrinth and Reflective Garden. It is a great place to take a small break. This tiny park is located on the library grounds. You don’t have to go too far to connect with nature and get some fresh air.</p>
<p>Unlike most parks, this area has a labyrinth. Labyrinths are circular trails designed for walking. These paths guide you to the center and then back to the beginning. According to <a href="http://www.labyrinths.org/">the Labyrinth Society</a>, labyrinths are used for psychological and spiritual development. They could also strengthen your right brain abilities, including creativity. Maybe this walk will provide the inspiration you need for your school work.</p>
