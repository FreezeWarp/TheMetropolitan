<p>The tantalizingly good weather in late spring has been a distraction for everyone trying to finish up school projects, but we’ll all soon have time to release our pent-up desire to break free from academia. However, whether you’re graduating or not, you probably don’t want to blow a lot of money on recreation.</p>
<p>Here are a few things around the Twin Cities that the Metropolitan staff is going to take advantage of this summer. Sure, you can do a number of these things all year, but if you’re like us, you were too busy, tired, or guilt-ridden (“I really should write this paper now”) to enjoy them.</p>
<p>Since the University draws students from 24 counties, we’ve included a couple destination attractions. In other cases, we hope to inspire your own localized version of this list.</p>

<h2><a href="http://flatearthbrewing.com">Flat Earth Brewery (688 Minnehaha Avenue East, Saint Paul, Minnesota 55106)</a></h2>
<p>The Twin Cities is now home to at least a dozen independent breweries that have taprooms and sell growler, but we wanted to highlight Flat Earth (see article) because it’s been around a while and is near Metropolitan State. </p>
<p>Other taprooms include the nearby Sidhe brewing on Payne Avenue as well as Surly, Insight Brewing, 612 Brew, Dangerous Man and a host of others that can make for an interesting tour (as long as you designate a driver!). Pints and flights at taprooms are typically less than at bars or restaurants, and each brewery seems to have its own distinct atmosphere.</p>


<h2>Live Theater and Shows</h2>
<p>Evening classes and work obligations prevent many students from exploring the Twin Cities thriving theater scene. At one point, we had more theaters per capita than anywhere outside of NYC.</p>
<p>Although people think of the Guthrie Theater and the evening gowns and formal wear that seem to accompany high ticket prices, there are many small companies doing great (and sometimes experimental) work in dozens of smaller venues.</p>

<h2><a href="http://www.hugetheater.com/">Huge Improv Theater (3037 S. Lyndale Avenue, Minneapolis)</a></h2>
<div class="slider">
    <img src="images/2016-06-01-006-2.jpg" alt="">
</div>
<p>As the name suggests, Huge Improv Theater hosts a lot of unscripted comedy. Many of the ongoing weekly performances have the same format but different performers (both well-known and up-and-coming), giving the audience a taste of their signature styles. Shows range from the all-stars performing “Show X” on Mondays to the “Space Jam” open stage on Thursday to an array of performers on weekends.</p>
<p>Of course, you never know how improv is going to turn out, but it will always be interesting.</p>


<h2><a href="http://www.moundstheatre.org/">Mounds Theatre (1029 Hudson Road, Saint Paul)</a></h2>
<div class="slider">
    <img src="images/2016-06-01-006-3.jpg" alt="">
</div>
<p>Where else can you regularly see family-friendly wrestling, local comedians, burlesque shows, a psychobilly concert and live radio shows—and “A Klingon Christmas Carol”? The Mounds Theatre in the heart of Dayton’s Bluff on St. Paul’s East Side—that’s where.</p>
<p>This hidden gem of a venue is a refurbished movie house from the 1920s. Performers sometimes incorporate the art deco vibe into their performances. </p>
<p>The variety of events is by design, as executive director Jessica Johnson said, and providing a place for smaller scale, niche acts is one of the theater’s goals. Of course, they also bring in companies and plays with broad appeal that sell out, like last December’s run of “A Klingon Christmas Carol.”</p>


<h2><a href="http://minnesotamusiccafe.com/">The Minnesota Music Café (449 Payne Avenue, Saint Paul)</a></h2>
<div class="slider">

</div>
<p>Concerts are the other type of live show you can enjoy with impunity after being freed from the shackles of your syllabi and deadlines.</p>
<p>If you’re like me, you’ve driven past the Minnesota Music Café on your way to class dozens of times and thought about stopping in if you weren’t running late. However, it is a good place to go after an evening class because that’s when things really ramp up.</p>
<p>True to its name, the Minnesota Music Café has concerts seven days a week. Their bookings lean toward blues, R & B, and funk, but they also feature some rock bands. Check their listings, enjoy a drink and nosh on some traditional pub fare as you listen.</p>


<h2><a href="http://www.comozooconservatory.org/">Como Zoo and Park (1225 Estabrook Dr, St Paul)</a></h2>
<div class="slider">
    <img src="images/2016-06-01-006-5.jpg" alt="">
    <img src="images/062016006-51.jpg" alt="">
</div>
<p>In the scope of conservation in Minnesota, Como Zoo has been the institution. No other zoo or conservation center has been as accessible to the public or with such a wide scope. Although donations are always accepted, as well as memberships, general admission to the zoo has always been free. With the wide variety of species and an iconic botanical garden, the zoo has been one of the most reliable attractions in the state.</p>
<p>Other paid services include the amusement park and an on-site restaurant.</p>


<h2><a href="http://www.metrocouncil.org/parks.aspx">Twin Cities Parks</a></h2>
<div class="slider">
    <img src="images/2016-06-01-006-7.jpg" alt="">
</div>
<p>The Twin Cities has one of the most extensive public parks programs in the entire country. Minnehaha Falls, Fort Snelling Park, and Como Park remain some of the largest in the area. But for Eastside St. Paul, Phalen Park remains the most varied and notable.</p>


<h2>Ice Cream</h2>
<p>I scream, you scream, we all scream for affordable desserts. Open year round, Izzy’s and Grand Ol’ Creamery—both off of Grand Ave. in St. Paul, and Sebastian Joe’s off of Hennepin Ave. in Minneapolis, offer some of the best desserts in the Twin Cities. These aren’t your great grandparents’ ice cream shops—nor are they your standard 31 flavors shop. </p>
<p>Some flavors may be a little experimental and out there, but you probably won’t be disappointed—your wallet sure won’t.</p>


<h2>Movies in the Park</h2>
<p>https://www.thrillist.com/events/minneapolis/twin-cities-outdoor-movie-calendar-2015-free-summer-film-screenings-twin-cities</p>
<p>Movies, parks, and picnics: a trio for a Minnesota summer for anybody wanting to stretch their legs and then proceed to sit down for two hours. Over the summer months, both Minneapolis and St. Paul feature free movies open to the public. Depending on the park and depending on the day, the movies are different, but typically are family friendly—always double check just to be sure!</p>


<h2>Museums</h2>
<div class="slider">
    <img src="images/2016-06-01-006-6.jpg" alt="">
</div>
<p>Minneapolis Institute of Art (MIA); Walker Art Center; Weisman Art Museum; Minnesota History Center</p>
<p>The Twin Cities has a plethora of museums and historical societies, which are either free or largely discounted for students with school IDs; MIA and the Weisman are free all the time. While the Minnesota History Center and the Walker may cost money, the former has free attendance on Tuesdays from 5-8 p.m. and the latter has free attendance every Thursday night after five as well as the first Saturday of the month—but, with a student ID, the Walker’s attendance is always $9.</p>


<h2><a href="http://saintsbaseball.com/">Saint Paul Saints Baseball</a></h2>
<p>With a brand new stadium and an overwhelmingly successful homecoming season, the Saints have the wind behind them going into their 2016 season. The old Midway stadium may have been a fan favorite, but the new CHS Field in the heart of Lowertown, right down the street from Metro State’s main campus, is absolutely dynamic. With tickets as low as $5 and handout items virtually every week, a day at the game is—ahem—a home run.</p>


<h2><a href="http://www.wabashastreetcaves.com/">Wabasha Caves</a></h2>
<p>Everything needed for a pre-1950s night, “The Caves,” as it is known in the Twin Cities’ swing dance circles, has strong connections to mafia dealings in St. Paul’s underground catacombs. “It has a strong ambience,” said Metro student and “Rhythm and Swing” dancer Brittany Jacks. With swing dance night every Thursday featuring various jazz orchestras, and bands being $8 and tours starting at $6, the caves serve as an easy way to experience one of St. Paul’s most interesting historical aspects.</p>
