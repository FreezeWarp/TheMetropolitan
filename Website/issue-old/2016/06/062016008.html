<p>We were driving around searching for a fireworks show. It was the Fourth of July. With our spur-of-the-moment decision, my girlfriend and I hoped to witness the Independence Day celebration. In the distance, we could see brilliant flashes of light. Would these magnificent sparks bring us to the desired location?</p>
<p>Seek and Destroy, a well-known Metallica song, played in the background. As we traveled, the lyrics became “searching…seeking fireworks.” We were determined to find the ultimate fireworks show and witness the awe-filled display. Finally, we made it to our destination—or did we?  </p>
<p>As we got out of our vehicle, we noticed that most people were getting into theirs. It was a huge disappointment. The experience, however, gave us insight on what to do. This year, we will be more prepared to have an enjoyable fireworks experience—and so can you.  The appropriate information can help you plan.</p>

<strong>Research Fourth of July fireworks shows</strong>
<p>Since many cities have firework shows at different times during the summer, it is important to find out if your town has one this Independence Day. If not, you will have to travel. Some websites can provide you with event addresses. They can also help you verify their dates and times. </p>

<strong>Plan your trip.</strong>
<p>You can use your research information to arrange your night. For instance, you can use Mapquest to determine how much time you will need. It can also help you get there on time and have an opportunity for a bathroom break. If possible, you could organize your day around the performance. Your night could include a pre-show dinner or picnic in the area. By getting to your destination early, you could avoid traffic and save time finding a parking spot.</p>

<strong>Bring your supplies.</strong>
<p>Besides transporting others to the fireworks, you could bring a few supplies. A folding chair or blanket will make you more comfortable. Snacks and water will help you stay replenished and hydrated. Insect repellants will prevent you from getting bitten by mosquitoes and other bugs. A working flashlight may also be useful.</p>

<strong>Enjoy the show!</strong>
<p>The fireworks celebration on the Fourth of July comes once a year. It’s a special summertime event. This night is an occasion to honor our country’s traditions and patriotic values. It’s also fun, entertaining and free!  Hopefully, your Fourth of July, whatever you do, will be enjoyable.</p>
