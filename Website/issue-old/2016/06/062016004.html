<article><p>Summer is officially here, which means several things: extra daytime, warm weather, and businesses are hiring seasonal employees. This is a great time to drop the books and make some cash. Having a summer job is a great way to test out a field you’re interested in or pursue a hobby. </p>
<p>My first summer job was a seasonal position working at Macy’s in the cosmetics department. I had always been interested in makeup, skincare products, human biology, and business. This summer job shaped my future in a wonderful way. Because of this experience I decided to attend Aveda and establish myself in the beauty industry. For over a decade I worked under world renowned hair stylists, helped open and run spas/salons and write customer service manuals and corporate materials. My summer job led me to future employers. I still keep connections from that job to help find leads for new employment.</p>
<p>One way to find a job you love is to think about the places you frequent, or items and activities you enjoy. If you are tech savvy, maybe applying at the Microsoft or Apple store would be a good fit. If you enjoy it, applying for regular part-time positions may be an option. Places like these offer great discounts and, if hired on as a regular employee (even as part-time), they can offer educational assistance.</p>
<p>If you are strong and don’t mind physical activity, places like PepsiCo, UPS, Federal Express, and many more are hiring for overnight shifts for seasonal employees doing more physical jobs. This can be a good way to get in shape and make some cash. </p>
<p>For those of you who love the outdoors and don’t mind a little sun, places like Home Depot, Menards, Bachman’s and landscaping companies are a great way to learn about business and gardening. In addition, if you enjoy the work you can move around in larger retail companies and learn about different departments. This allows room to network and meet new people.</p>
<p>My husband (and a fellow Metro State student) met me while he worked his first summer job at Dairy Queen. It was love at first ice cream cone—I mean sight. He won my heart with some soft serve. You never know who you are going to meet at a summer job or where it will lead you. But you will gain experience to put on your resume, hopefully meet new friends, and earn some extra spending money.</p>
<p>Have a wonderful summer!</p></article>
