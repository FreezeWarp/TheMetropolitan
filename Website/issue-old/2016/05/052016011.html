<h1 class="articletitle">Spending money may be the fiscally responsible option</h1>

<article><p>Fiscal responsibility and protecting the taxpayer are two of the most common phrases bandied about whenever public money is involved. At face value the intentions are good, but it often results in choosing the cheapest possible option. But sometimes spending more money is the most responsible thing to do.</p>
<p>Two examples on the Metropolitan State University campus are the new fitness center in the New Student Center and the video-editing lab in the basement of Founders Hall.</p>
<p>The fitness center already has a good number of users, even though it has yet to install all the equipment. Early reports indicate that usage surges in the morning and during the lunch hour. Overall, it is a great addition to the campus.</p>
<p>However, to me, it’s quickly reaching capacity. To me, this is a case of fiscal responsibility run amok at the state Capitol, whose members saved the taxpayer thousands of dollars by keeping it small.</p>
<p>Not going big with this project was a missed opportunity to better serve the public and to potentially make some money. A bigger fitness center at Metropolitan State could have eventually become a community asset. And while students might have disjointed enough schedules to go to the gym during a down time, the small size will likely hamper revenue garnered from employee memberships. </p>
<p>Unlike students, employees are more apt to only use the fitness center in the morning before work or during their lunch break. The fact that there is a good chance that all three treadmills could be occupied at those times has likely dissuaded some employees from purchasing memberships.</p>
<p>The video-editing lab in Founders Hall is a different story. While it’s filled with excellent computers equipped with great editing software, it’s only available to students for six measly hours a week—9:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. Tuesday and Thursday. The rationale I was given was that people only use the lab just before an assignment is due.</p>
<p>While that is undoubtedly true, the driver of that behavior might be that many Metropolitan State students have families or jobs that prevent them for using the lab at that time of day—and they only take time off work to go to the lab when absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>This is like spending money to buy and maintain an Olympic-sized pool but only letting people use it during the six hours each week that a lifeguard is present.</p>
<p>To be sure, there will be a lonely lab attendant for some time if the hours of operation were increased, but once word gets out, people will use it, which is the point of having these great learning tools on campus.</p>
<p>Being fiscally responsible means looking at more than the bottom line.</p></article>
