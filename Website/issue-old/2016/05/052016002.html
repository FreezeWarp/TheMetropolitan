<p>Diversity is one of Metro State’s finest strengths. For more than twenty years now, a shining example of this is the school’s exchange program with universities in Taiwan. In 1994, Tamkang University—located in the city of Taipei—approached Metro State’s College of Management Department (COM), with a proposal to help graduate students earn their MBAs. </p>
<p>International Programs Director/Department Chair (COM) Carol Bormann Young—who began at Metro State in 1995—was teaching a strategy class at that time, and was one of the faculty members who went to Taiwan in 1996. “When we started this program it was almost all masters, very few bachelor’s degrees,” Young said. “And they were working adults, very similar to our students here, they were not necessarily full-time students; they were councilmen and councilwomen, state government workers, and business people who were doing this MBA program in addition to working full-time,” she added.</p>
<p>Young and the other faculty spent about three weeks in Taiwan, teaching accelerated classroom courses. The students would then follow up with projects and papers, sending them to Metro State for grading and credit. “They [students] would then come here for two to four weeks to finish up their capstone course and attend the graduation ceremony,” Young said.</p>
<p>One change over the years has come in the form of partnerships and universities. Metro State now works with two different universities, both also in Taipei: China University of Technology (CUTe), and Takming University of Science and Technology (TMUST). There was also a past collaboration with National Taipei University in the city of Hsinchu; the campus is located in Science Park, which is “similar to our Silicon Valley, it’s very technology oriented,” Young said. </p>
<p>Another change has been in the gradual trend toward a more youthful student base in Taiwan, and Metro State’s international program has adjusted accordingly. Taiwanese students now come here to finish their degrees. In the past, the average number of the Taiwanese cohort was about twenty-five students. But the present academic school year (2015-16) saw a spike to forty-three students; that’s because it’s a year of transition. </p>
<p>The Taiwan International Education Association—Metro State’s international programs partner, coordinated by Alex Feng—decided that recruiting undergraduates would be in their best interest for the future. So, in 2012, Roger Prestwich—who was the director at the time—went to Taiwan to help in that process. (Having taken over the position after Prestwich retired, Young returned to Taiwan in 2013 to recruit the students who will start here this fall.) These students have spent the last three years in Taiwan pursuing their bachelor’s degrees and are now at Metro State for their final year. The undergraduates—as well as the Taiwanese graduate students—will walk through the spring graduation ceremony and then finish their last courses this summer. </p>
<p>This first year of undergraduates is also the last year of graduate students (hence, the number spike: nineteen bachelor’s students and twenty-four MBAs). “So, in a way, it’s a beginning and an end,” as Young put it. Since the students’ time spent here is a year in length, this also means a Minnesota winter and, for most of them, their first experience with snow.</p>
<p>The students—with most undergraduates ranging in age from twenty-two to twenty-four years—are housed at University Village. Home to a number University of Minnesota students, it is located just off its campus on University Avenue. “We really liked the University Village facility because it gave the students what we hoped was more of a campus feel,” Young said. “We felt a need for that type of setting; one example that convinced me of this was when, during the admissions interview process, one of the questions asked was, ‘where can I play basketball?’” Young added with a laugh.  </p>
<p>For the MBAs that have been coming to Metro State over the past several years, the classes comprise all Taiwanese students; the classes also provide interpreters. But that will change because the incoming undergraduates take English classes during their three years in Taiwan and are English proficient. They also arrive here early (in July) to further improve their English before fall semester starts. The undergraduates are also mixed in with local students in their classes; many Minnesota students take on leadership roles in class to help the Taiwanese students when needed. </p>
<p>Once the Taiwanese students earn their bachelor’s degrees, they will also become the recipients of Metro State’s recently implemented “Dual Degree Program.” Once graduated, the students will have dual degrees, one from their respective school in Taiwan and one from Metro State. This goes hand in hand with the recent signings of a “Sister University Agreement” between Metro State and both Taiwan schools: CUTe and TMUST. This agreement serves as “a public signing to show that we have a formal relationship,” Young stated. The agreement also allows for a freer exchange of information and ideas in such areas as assessments, coursework, and curriculum.</p>
<p>This agreement has also led to a “Sister” signing between Metro State and Chongqing Jiaotong University (CQJU) in Chongqing, China (mainland). While still in the early stages, in 2014 this collaboration resulted in Metro State hosting two visiting professors from CQJU: Xiohong Ren and Xia Zhang. Their impressions after a few months here: “The Twin Cities is a very good place, with beautiful scenery and friendly people. Although it’s a little cold and snowy in winter, we feel very warm in our hearts.”</p>
<p>These days, duties as director and department chair for the College of Management keep Young from teaching as much as she used to. Prior to that, though, Young taught a variety of classes to both graduate and undergraduate students. Young saw fulfillment of this when she went to Taiwan in 2013 and was able to sit down to dinner with about ten of her past students; one of them being Alex Feng, now coordinator of Metro State’s international partner in Taiwan. “When I go to recruit in Taiwan, we have some fun with telling the story that Alex is my student,” Young says with a smile.</p>
<p>With the graduation of this year’s students, Metro State will have over 850 Taiwanese alumni. Young summed up the gratification of her involvement over the years, “It has been my honor to teach in this program and to coordinate this program; it gives me an understanding on a completely different level.”</p></article>
