<p>With the presidential search wrapping up and a new university president expected to be named this June, I took some time to speak with outgoing president, Devinder Malhotra. President Malhotra has been the interim president for two years. He reflects on the time at Metro State and what the future may hold for the university. </p>
<p><strong>How long have you been here?</strong></p>
<p>Since July, 2014. So two years. That was the intent. The intent was that I would come in and lead the institution for two years. </p>
<p><strong>And what did you do before that?</strong></p>
<p>Before that, I was provost at Saint Cloud State University. </p>
<p><strong>And you’ve been in education for your entire career? Is that right?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I’ve been either on the faculty or in an administrative role since 1979. So it’s been a long time. </p>
<p><strong>When you say you’ve been on the faculty, that means you’ve taught?</strong></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>What did you teach?</strong></p>
<p>Economics. ln fact, I’ve been faculty longer than I’ve been an administrator. I was a full-time faculty member right up until 1999. So I’ve been an administrator only for 16 years. </p>
<p><strong>Why did you decide to switch over?</strong></p>
<p>You know, I don’t think I decided to switch over. I was perfectly content. In fact, I sort of fancy myself as an academic and faculty member who happens to administrate. So it was a series of “accidents.” So. I’m an accidental administrator. Opportunities arose. I looked at it and it seemed like a good thing to do. One thing lead to another and here I am 16 years later. </p>
<p><strong>What was your first administrative job?</strong></p>
<p>I initially worked as Associate Dean in a big college of arts and sciences at the University of Akron. And then in 2005, I moved to Portland Maine at the University of Southern Maine where I became a dean in the College of Arts and Sciences. I oversaw the communications department. </p>
<p><strong>So you started out in Akron?</strong></p>
<p>In Akron, I started out as an assistant professor of economics and became associate professor. Then in 1989 I became a full professor of economics. I was department chair in the mid 90’s and in ‘99, I moved full time into administration. </p>
<p><strong>And did you get your education there?</strong></p>
<p>No, I was born in India. I got my bachelor’s from Saint Stephen’s college, which is part of the University of Delhi. And then I got my masters’ in Delhi School of Economics which is also part of the University of Delhi. And then I came to this country and I went to Kansas State University and I got my PhD in economics. And then I moved to Akron. </p>
<p><strong>Did you always know that you wanted to be in education?</strong></p>
<p>No, not really. Not till I started doing my PhD. While I was doing my PhD in Economics, and this is fairly common for those of us who have gone through PhD programs, towards the middle and end of your PhD program they will assign you classes to teach. And they pay you so that way you are able to pursue your education. </p>
<p>When I went into the classroom, I really liked that. So I decided to pursue a career in academics. </p>
<p><strong>So it wasn’t until you actually got into the classroom that you realized “Oh, this might be a career path for me.” </strong></p>
<p>You don’t get the feel of what you’re doing until you actually do it. And whether you like it or not. </p>
<p><strong>Have you ever thought that you might want to go into the private sector?</strong></p>
<p>You know, I’ve had opportunities. I started off my career working for the planning commission of India, which is at the federal level, in my early 20’s as an economic researcher. When I finished my PhD, I had job offers from the private sector too, and a couple of the universities. And so I thought hard and long and I decided I wanted to pursue academics rather than going into the private sector. </p>
<p><strong>And why is academics so important to you?</strong></p>
<p>At that time, I was really interested in not only the classroom, but also pursuing my academic research. If you go to the private sector, you research what they ask you to research. But as an academic, I had a little more flexibility to pursue areas which were high in my set of priorities as issues to be researched and engage in that conversation on those topics with other economists.</p> 
<p>The space academics offered me to grow professionally is what attracted me to this job. </p>
<p><strong>Do you think that your background in economics has helped you in your administrative roles?</strong></p>
<p>I hope so. When you come to administration and when you are in leadership roles, you are really a product of what you have done in the past and how you have approached things in the past. You can’t really change that. </p>
<p>Economics deals with understanding how economic agents or individuals make choices in the face of scarcity. And as administrators, we are constantly making choices in the face of scarcity. So I think some of that thinking may have transferred, but leadership is also more of an art than a science. When I’m engaged in a decision-making process, or thinking about some issue, or leading a particular conversation, I don’t consciously think of “What would an economist think?” You just go ahead. But I’m sure it creeps into my thinking here and there. </p>
<p><strong>What are some of the tough decisions you have had to make? </strong></p>
<p>It’s not a decision, but a series of decisions. I think it is to think through with the rest of the university community and engage them in thinking around how we can move the institution towards a sustainable, growth-oriented future. So the toughness is not embedded in a decision, but a series of decisions. And to make sure that you stay focused and are coordinated and cohesive in your approach.  </p>
<p>These decisions are fraught with complexity and require thinking and often we have to operate in an environment where there may be incomplete information or uncertainty about the future. That’s the nature of this beast. </p>
<p><strong>I suppose, being the leader of such a big organization with so many different voices and perspectives, it’s hard to know what the best way is for the most people?</strong></p>
<p>I don’t know whether it’s hard to know what the best way is. The decision you ultimately make often is not readily accessible to you. You know? Some decisions are very black and white for various reasons. In some instances you may not have a choice. So to me that’s relatively easy, you don’t have to do much thinking. Or something is of such overriding importance that it may be easy to move in that direction.</p>
<p>So, to your question, ultimately, it’s not an individual, whether that individual is president or in any other significant leadership position, who can change the direction of the institution it is really the university community: faculty, staff, students, who together think and come to a shared understanding about the history of the institution, but also where they would like the institution to be.</p>
<p>You come to that shared understanding about where we are coming from and where we want to be. The leadership role is to facilitate and engage in a conversation with that community so that we all have the ability to review the information, assess all the options, and then pick approaches and make choices to move the institution towards that desired state.</p>
<p>And that’s the strategic part, which is fraught with a lot of complexity. It is the leadership’s role to listen to a multiplicity of perspectives and then try to sort that out and go through an iterative process with the university community. “This is what I heard. Is that what you’re saying?” And then you refine your thinking as an institution, rather than as an individual. </p>
<p>As an individual, I may have X, Y, Z preferences, but that’s not the way to approach the leadership role. The leadership role also has to engage the broader university community and learn from them. It’s true that we are constantly, as a university, engaged in teaching and learning. That’s what we do in our interactions with our students. But we, as a university, as an institution, as an organization, also have to become a learning organization. We learn from each other. We learn from our peer institutions. We learn from the national context. And then we put in all the information and we come up as to what makes sense as to how to approach a particular issue or topic, or in general how to move the institution forward. </p>
<p><strong>On a practical level, how do you get that? How do you collect those thoughts?</strong></p>
<p>When you look at organizations like universities, there is a very strong tradition of shared governance. Usually it refers to the interactions which the leadership or the managerial side of the institution has with the faculty and staff. There is a strong tradition of consultative structures. But we have been much more intentional also. For example, a year and a half ago we created a strategic planning advisory committee, which has representation from all areas of the university, including students. Student government also has representatives there. </p>
<p>Essentially, what happens then is this group, engages the broader university community and evaluates the different options and then makes recommendations. </p>
<p>And those recommendations come in to the administration and then internally, we look at it, how to resource those recommendations, and what kind of operational frames will deliver the goals underlying those recommendations. And then we link strategic planning to the allocation of resources that the institution has, for the benefit of our students. </p>
<p>In general, when we think strategically as an institution, what we are really are thinking about is: how can we provide access, in an enhanced manner to higher education to all communities out there? And then, how can we ensure that once these students enter our institution we provide a facilitation and an environment in which they can succeed? And, by success, I mean not only they graduate, but also that they can meet their aspirational goals and their personal goals, both in life and work. </p>
<p><strong>Sounds like a lot of complexity. </strong></p>
<p>Yes, there’s a lot of complexity. But almost any observed phenomena is complex. If you think of just the physical world, it is also complex. If you think of life sciences, they are also complex. There is complexity as to how we approach this work. But then, there are ways in which to deal with complexity. That’s where data-driven decision making and developing information sets helps us understand not only the complexity, but also helps us move towards approaches which may be complex, but we can break down that complexity into different segments and then deal with each so we can proceed in a coordinated, cohesive manner. </p>
<p><strong>What would you say has been the biggest success of the school in the time that you’ve been here?</strong></p>
<p>I don’t really focus on the success of individuals, but I focus more on the success of structures, what structures and approaches will lead to success for the institution. These two years have been extremely gratifying to me. I’ve learned a lot from the university community. I have been very fortunate to be here and be part of the journey of this institution. This institution has a long history of success. And it is going from that state of being very, very good to being great. </p>
<p>In that thinking, over the last two years, the university as a whole has really asked very foundational questions. What is our identity as an institution? We talked a lot about what a public, urban university ought to look like. </p>
<p>What is our focus? At a very simple level, that is obvious. Our focus is on student success. On creating an environment where students can maximize their innate potential. The foundational question we ask ourselves is: Given our history, given the context in which we are operating, given the amount of resources we have, what kind of an organizational structure will best deliver on the promise to the students?</p>
<p>There has been a lot of that conversation. We’ve gone through organizational restructuring at the institutional level. We have integrated student affairs and academic affairs into one division so that they can be more coordinated in their impact on student success.</p>
<p>We have created a new college and rethought our other college structures. We have, through strategic planning conversations and through enrollment management conversations and various other conversations, asked ourselves the question: would it take to, let’s say, double our graduates in the next five to seven years. What would it take to move the institution with an enrollment of 11,500 to 17,000? What it would take, in other words, to move towards a sustainable, growth-oriented future?</p>
<p>So there, we are looking at how we should formulate our budgets. We went through a lot of thinking about that. What are some of these strategic approaches we would need to accomplish? And what kind of organizational structure will deliver on those strategic approaches?</p>
<p>This conversation has been very exciting, very reinvigorating. At a very simple level, I would say in the last two years, this university has been engaged in conversations where it has been rethinking its own profession and its own place in today’s changing world. And that has been very, very exciting. I was fortunate and privileged and honored to be part of that conversation. </p>
<p><strong>So how do you feel, after engaging in all those conversations and being a part of that planning?</strong></p>
<p>I would say, as I leave this institution, I’m very bullish on Metropolitan State. Metropolitan State has very strong fundamentals. It is well-aligned to the changing demographics. Just to give you a sense, 40 percent of our students are either Native Americans or come from communities of color. Close to 70 percent either are from communities of color or are PAR-eligible, which is a proxy for low income, or are first-generation college entrants. </p>
<p>Did you know that 50 percent of our science majors are women? A third of our science majors come from communities of color, which is very unlike any other institution. </p>
<p>And so we take this, and you look at the other side; almost 100 percent of the additional Twin Cities metropolitan region over the next ten years will come from communities of color. So we know that the population, as well as the workforce will become more diverse. </p>
<p>Traditionally, these communities have been denied access to higher education. Most of these communities have a very low participation rate, but that’s where our strength is: we have been embedded in these communities and engaging students from these communities for the more than 40 years. And so we bring this strength and are well-aligned to the changing demographics. </p>
<p>Somebody asked me the other day, “What is the rationale for a public, urban university such as Metropolitan State?” And our rationale is very simple. Our rationale is to address the insufficiency of higher education to deal with issues facing the urban communities. It is to rid higher education of its elitist and insular character. </p>
<p>Purely from that standpoint, we are well-aligned to the demographics. We are a very flexible, adaptable, nimble institution, which has strong, passionate, committed, devoted faculty and staff who have traditionally focused on student success.</p>
<p>We have very strong success metrics. Did you know that entering students in Metropolitan State graduate with a four year degree with a median time of 2.7 years. It is true that most of the students we get are transfer students. Two thirds of our students are transfer students. </p>
<p>They come with a couple of years under their belt. Or they are adult students who have worked outside and are coming back to the university. They are much more focused and motivated and know what they are looking for. The point is, when they come, they are able to accomplish success. So the transformative power of a public, urban university is a lot stronger. </p>
<p>Just to give you a statistic: 50 percent of the emerging jobs are going to require a four-year degree. So the workforce will be coming from diversified communities, and they will need four-year degrees. Now universities which are engaging those communities and creating opportunities for them to get four-year degrees or graduate degrees are the once who will become most central to the vibrancy of the region itself. </p>
<p>Therefore, the centrality of Metropolitan State to the economic, social, cultural, and intellectual vibrancy of the Twin Cities region is actually increasing day by day. We are becoming more salient and more central to the economic, social, cultural, and intellectual well-being of the community. </p>
<p>So that’s why I’m bullish. That’s why I think we are poised for a very strong, sustainable, growth-oriented future. </p>
<p><strong>That’s awesome. </strong></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>So, if that’s what’s ahead for Metro State, what’s ahead for you?</strong></p>
<p>I’m retiring, finally, after 37 years. I’m going to go back and do what I joined the academic profession for: some reading, writing, and thinking in terms of research and scholarship.  </p>
<p>My specialty in economics is regional economics. I’m going to study the impact universities make on communities and the ways in which that impact is transferred. And how do communities shape the type of universities they have and vice versa. Not only how universities shape the communities in which they are located, but also how the communities themselves shape the functioning of the universities. </p>
<p>So this interaction between the communities and institutions of higher education hopefully will be the focus of my research. </p>
<p><strong>That sounds fun.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, I’m looking forward to it. I think I will do some traveling, some reading and writing and just be my own boss.</p></article>
