<p>Kadija Naïma Touré is a Metropolitan State University Alumni. She graduated in 2014 with a bachelor’s degree in public relations. Kadija is the founder of a nonprofit organization called Le Projet Écoute that is dedicated to help prevent childhood sexual abuse within the African context.</p>
<p>According to Touré, Le Projet Écoute means “The “Listening Project.” When it comes to children disclosing abuse, most parents would rather not imagine this happening to their own children, so they listen but do not hear what the child is saying. “It is easier to brush off such a big problem this way,” said Touré.</p>
<p>In 2013, she became actively involved in addressing the issue of child sexual abuse, especially in her home country of Guinea. “It is an issue that needs to be addressed, as it is long overdue,” Touré said. “I also find it extremely important to define the problem of childhood sexual abuse within the specifics of Africa.” </p>
<p>“Le Projet Écoute uses an inclusive, community-based approach to heighten safety awareness focusing on knowledge, skills and responsibility, but taking cultural realities into account,” said Touré.</p>
<p>According to Touré, in her home country of Guinea, some parents have the tendency to deal with the issue of child sexual abuse between themselves and the abuser without involving authorities. The matter is kept private. “This is really bad because that same predator is free to do it again, he doesn’t even have to move to a different neighborhood,” said Touré.</p>
<p>In Guinea, Le Projet Écoute was officially registered as a nonprofit organization on May 1, 2014.</p>
<p>Since the organization began, it has directly impacted approximately 4,000 children. “We are pretty proud of that.” said Touré. “It’s hard for me to define success in a matter where even one child victim is one too many we consider every little step in the fight a victory.”</p>
<p>The organization runs an outreach program to educate children, “We created the ColorMeSafe program, which is designed to empower children and reduce their risk for victimization. The program is part of the first phase of Le Projet Écoute and is mainly delivered in schools.”</p>
<p>In the region, there is a lot of focus on empowering girls and preventing unwanted pregnancies for teenagers, but a complete disregard for the sexual abuse of children. According to a 2010 UNICEF report on school-related violence in West and Central Africa:</p>
<p>“Girls are the primary victims of sexual violence, abuse and exploitation perpetrated by male teachers and school staff or male students. This is confirmed by all studies in the region. Sexual violence of boys by teachers (both male and female) appears to be marginal.” The phenomenon reflects socially ingrained gender-based power disparities which exist both inside and outside the classroom.”</p>
<p>Touré said that her organization faces some big challenges; they are often faced with the lack of resources on the ground, things that are often taken for granted in the Western world, such as consistent electricity or high speed internet. She said, “We rely on donations in time and money and the current economic climate restrain some from charitable donations.”</p>
<p>“Some obstacles have to do with breaking barriers and taboos,” said Touré. “For instance, some parents are skeptical about allowing their children to enroll into our program. They misinterpret child sexual abuse and are mainly concerned that their child is going to be unnecessarily frightened and taught information that is not age appropriate.”</p>
<p>It is hard for some parents, according to Touré, “to disassociate sexual abuse prevention classes with sexual education classes. So we work hard to draw out a clear distinction between the two.” She states that their major focus is to prevent child sexual abuse and that they are challenging mindsets which is never an easy task.</p>
<p>In its mission statement, Le Projet Écoute highlights the fact that it provides means and tools to prevent the sexual abuse of the most vulnerable. This year, due to the immediate need of the children displaced by Ebola, Touré and her organization “will modify our traditional ‘information day workshops’ to be delivered in open spaces where children without access to school can still sign up and receive our program with a priority being given to the displaced children of ebola. We will also have workshops days in orphanages.”</p>
<p>Touré implores people to educate themselves about childhood sexual abuse and its consequences. “It is the most underlooked cause of so many issues that take the forefront such as child marriages and early pregnancies,” said Touré.</p>
