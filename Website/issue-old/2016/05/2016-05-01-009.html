<article><p><strong>Dear Dr. Kev,</strong></p>

<p><strong>First, I want to thank you for your great, detailed advice last fall about the pros and cons of dating a woman who already had a couple of gentleman callers (last time we called her Barb). I opted not to jump into the fray and have developed a solid, drinking-buddy type of friendship instead. (I have since found that she prefers romantic gestures like roses from her fellas, so I'm pretty sure we would have been a disaster).</strong></p>

<p><strong>But I'm troubled by a couple of things. First, I've discovered that she sometimes talks about me in order to press her potential mates to step up their game. Apparently, I'm some sort of looming presence. She goes out of her way show affection towards me in front of her main boyfriend. Does this make me a bad guy?</strong></p>

<p><strong>It goes deeper than just a few side comments. I can’t say for sure, but I’m pretty sure one of her boyfriends egged my car the other weekend. How can I maintain a friendship with Barb without needing to scrape potential poultry off my windshield every other weekend?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Second, by hanging out, I've met a number of her single friends. Of course, she always tells me their worst quality first. This isn't my first rodeo, so I know the reason why and don't really care, but still find it a little annoying. What compels women to do stuff like this? It's like they are collecting guys like Pokémon. </strong></p>

<p><strong>Sincerely</strong>,</p>

<p>Dear Safety School of the Dating Pool,</p>

<p>I’m happy to hear my advice didn’t result in undue weeping or gnashing of teeth. One can never have too many drinking buddies. If she’s all flower and chocolates and you’re more beers and popcorn, then it sounds like you made a good choice.</p>

<p>All congrats aside, Barb is flaunting you for relationship leverage. To answer your first question directly, no, I don’t think that makes you a bad person. Some folks take a certain sadistic pleasure in watching their platonic relationships threaten the salience of another, like a soldier in some Cold War missile silo fondling the H-Bomb switch, knowing they have the power to end things but never getting the go-ahead from mission HQ. Every slow embrace, every shared moment of spontaneous laughter, stolen by a thief in the nighttime and stashed somewhere for comfort.</p>
<p>This does not sound like you. When you’ve already waded through the carrot soup, why bother making it too hot for anyone else to drink? That said, how do you respond to her affection? Do you bask in it like a sun-bleached seal or shy away, blushing and bashful? If you’re uncomfortable with the way she treats you in regards to her gentleman callers, go with the latter rather than the former.</p>
<p>Which brings us to the open-air-omelet splattered across your vehicle. Have you spoke with her boyfriend(s) about your situation? It may warrant some explanation. Perhaps they assume you and Barb are getting freaky on the side and it offends their delicate sensibilities. Set the record straight.</p>
<p>I’m not sure what sort of persona you may or may not have cultivated for yourself among this group, but a little tough guy rhetoric might help keep your car clean. Have you told them any stories from your all-too-brief stint in amateur boxing, The Marines, the county jail, or just a series of increasingly violent bar brawls? (OK, it was really more like a bar scuffle. Ok, it was really more like I woke up on the floor at Williams surrounded by peanut shells and cops with a concussion and still didn’t get that girl’s number. Or did she give me a fake number? Who can remember? They say you get, like, a couple of freebie concussions before you end up like a retired NFL player, but I’m skeptical. Anyway, she had a face like a cocker spaniel and a crazy ex-boyfriend, so it all worked out in the end). </p>
<p>I’m not sure why Barb wants to steer you away from her other friends. The answer likely lies outside of Dr. Kev’s expansive but inexact jurisdiction, perhaps better suited to the Sigmund Freud’s than the Sigmund Frauds. If I were to speculate, I would guess she is missing something in her life, and she uses relationships to cope.</p>
<p>I appreciate the update, and hope that the only eggs you wake up to are Grade A, cruelty-free and in your frypan.</p>

<p>Until next time, I remain:</p>

<p>Your friend,</p>
<p>Dr. Kev</p></article>
