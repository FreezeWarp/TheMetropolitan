<p>The former Hamms Brewery sat patiently abandoned on St. Paul’s East Side like some giant brick ship waiting for a captain. That is, up until Flat Earth Brewing Company opened its taproom in the Hamms building off Minnehaha and Payne Avenue, serving pints and growlers among the graffiti and concrete.</p>
<p>Heavy wooden doors guard the entrance with speakeasy-style peepholes allowing a non-existent bouncer to ask you for the password. You enter on the far right side of the taproom, near the growler coolers, which are separated from the bar. </p>
<p>The décor is a mix of rustic industrial and vintage Americana. A mish-mash of wooden tables and chairs spread out across the room make for a charming set up, like a holiday dinner where your grandmother pulled every spare piece of furniture into the living room to accommodate your large family. Games of several varieties are laid out on these tables, ranging from Rock Em’ Sock Em’ Robots to playing cards. Vintage scales and a Conn electric organ in the corner add to the Grandma’s house vibe.</p>
<p>The brown brick walls that dominate the interior are broken up by a smattering of murals. The taproom itself is separated down the middle by a wall and restrooms, with the bar on the far left end. </p>
<p>Passing over the restrooms you find the bar, stool-less and ready to serve. A pretty girl in a headband and cardigan is tending bar. She says their Cyngus porter is on nitro today- it’s only available in the taproom.</p>
<p>You order their IPA, because a craft brewery without a solid IPA can hardly call itself craft. You also might be a hipster. The brew is pleasantly hoppy, medium in body with some fruity notes. It pairs well with a game of Rock Em’ Sock Em’ Robots.</p>
<p>They’ve got all the other typical styles; a pale ale, Belgian-Style pale ale, along with their IPA and porter make up the year round taps. Another nine seasonal brews round out their roster. They range from a heavy coffee stout to a light lager, with several in between.</p>
<p>Eventually whatever you’re drinking will need to escape, at which point you realize the Flat Earth team has built their urinals out of old kegs cut down the middle.</p>
<p>Returning to the table, you see bikers and runners chasing their cardio buzz in Swede Hollow Park out the back window. </p>
<p>The bar tries to give back. A non-perishable food shelf setup near the front door looks like a permanent installment. The wall next to it is spotted with paperwork from the “Make-A-Wish” foundation.</p>
<p>Pretty-headband-bar-girl is back. “It’s last call,” she says, wondering if I want another beer.</p>
<p>Of course I do.</p></article>
