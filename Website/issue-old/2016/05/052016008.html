<article><p>What does it take to make your computer secure? You might say “install antivirus.” It seems simple, but the idea that you can set and forget one program to safeguard your data and devices is just not true anymore, if it ever was.</p>
<p>Last month’s article was about smartphone security, and you might remember its cheeky subtitle: “Easier than your computer.” Your phone has its own problems – the biggest one being physical security, since they’re more easily stolen than a laptop or desktop – but at the end of the day it’s pretty well locked-down. Computers take a little more work.</p>
<p><strong>Vectors</strong></p>
<p>The real problem with keeping a computer safe is the number of “attack vectors.” On a smartphone, new apps only come from one place: the app store. As long as Google, Apple or Microsoft put every app through a scanner, the likelihood of a malicious one making it all the way to your phone is pretty low.</p>
<p>A computer has many more doors for bad code to slip through! Web browsers, email attachments, or some program you downloaded for the promise of extra emoji in Skype. Most infections occur because users just don’t know how to identify a threat.</p>
<p><strong>Recognizing and Stopping Attacks</strong></p>
<p>Stop me if you’ve heard this one before: you’re browsing an article when a popup fills your screen, screaming about a virus. Or perhaps it was an email, masquerading as security advice. These “scareware” tactics aim to shock you into believing your data is already in danger, so the attackers can convince you to install something to actually make it so. Many infections start with a panicked user just following instructions.</p>
<p>In your browser, many threats load via malicious advertisements. The ethics of ad blocking are a subject of hot debate, but until ads stop being a common attack vector, blockers are a helpful insurance policy. AdblockPlus.org can get you started – it will block ads on most sites with some exceptions, and you can turn it off for websites you want to support with ad revenue.</p>
<p>Most email programs allow you to disable loading images or scripts by default for a “text only” view – you can reactivate them with a button press. Personal email accounts on sites like Gmail and Yahoo include the ability to report messages that get through the spam filter so they learn to stop them in the future. As for professional emails, the safe option is to report suspicious messages to your IT department. Don’t click the links or open attachments!</p>
<p>If an attack gets far enough to run its code, antivirus programs can usually catch them, but they need some help. First, make sure they’re installed correctly (not just running an expired trial) and don’t install more than one antivirus at the same time, or they’ll conflict. Second, set a schedule for scans and updates. An antivirus that never scans your hard drive or downloads new virus definitions (that’s how they know what is and isn’t a threat) doesn’t help.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, you’re not automatically safer if you use a Mac. Symantec Corporation, the company behind Norton Security, found in their 2016 Threat Report that Mac OS X has seen a rise in malware; attackers are catching on to Apple’s growing market share and responding with new exploits.</p>
<p>There are many antivirus options out there – I’ve personally tested half a dozen. Paid ones are often better, but free is usually fine. Your internet service provider might offer a complimentary subscription, which is convenient because your license is automatically paid with your internet bill. If that’s not an option, I won’t tell you what to get, but I’ll tell you where to look: Lifehacker and HowToGeek have been my go-to websites for new software for years, and they update their recommendations annually.</p>
<p><strong>This is the end of Tech Check</strong></p>
<p>By the time this issue hits stands, I’ll be graduated. It’s been two and a half years since I started Tech Check (even if the name didn’t come until later), and we’ve covered so many topics. From timely breakdowns on StarID and Network Neutrality, to apps to help you study, to the perennial “what’s up with the Wi-Fi?” piece. My mission was always to write articles that were not just informative, but actually useful to the average student, and it’s been a lot of work.</p>
<p>The Metropolitan is a small paper but it’s been a big part of my life. We finally have a proper website (only took two years to build it). Eventually there will be over a decade of past issues in the online archives, including many articles that haven’t been accessible in years.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p></article>
