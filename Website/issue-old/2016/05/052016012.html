<p>The new Science Education Center’s grand opening drew a crowd, including former Metropolitan State president Susan Hammersmith and her husband Allyn, two huge advocates for the facility.</p>
<p>But for some, the real show stoppers took place in the classrooms and labs, which will allow the university to diversify its programming to accommodate more for applied science, health-care students and prospective K-12 science teachers.</p>
<p>Professors and student researchers were on hand during the self-guided walking tour of the new digs to explain the importance of the new equipment and space. This includes 6,000 square feet of classroom space, the science and math tutoring center, and 19,500 square feet for labs. </p>
<p>Biology and anatomy students can now use a 3D projection to learn about physiology. The virtual dissections not only reduce the number of animals utilized, but are in some ways superior.</p>
<p>The 3D technology allows students to see how organs in action and responding to different stimuli, such as epinephrine. “You can see the heart beating,” Harley said.</p>
<p>It also allows students to compare the physiology of different species at the same time.</p>
<p>“It enables you to interact,” Harley said. “The limitation is creativity at this point.” </p>
<p>In assistant professor Kate Edelman’s room, visitors got the opportunity to make their own slime—and then use sulfuric acid to transform the glob back into a liquid.</p>
<p>For biology students Hnubqub Vang and Lorraine Onchiri, it was their first time making slime. Through the exercise, which explores intermolecular forces, they noted the precision required and importance of getting the proportions just right.</p>
<p>Down the hall, the analytic suite boasts an array of instrumentation that serves two vital purposes: first, students need to know how to use the equipment to get jobs, and its presence greatly increases the amount of research students can do at Metropolitan State.</p>
<p>The suite has four times as many work stations available for students than they did previously. The processing capabilities range from instruments to help analyze dilute samples to machines that speed up natural processes and more. </p>
<p>For example, one instrument can process a condensation reaction that would normally take a day in just eight minutes.</p>
<p>But for some reason, Edelman’s room seemed like the busiest one.</p>
<p>“Who doesn’t like to make slime?” Edelman said.</p>
