<strong><p>Dear Dr. Kev,</p>

<p>My girlfriend and I haven't been together very long, but she's a super lady and I'm hoping to hold on to this relationship for a while. The only issue is that she plans to join the U.S. military, which will, for all intents and purposes, end our relationship, given that neither of us is willing to do the long distance thing. However, she cannot join up without reaching a certain BMI, which has inspired me to consider sabotaging her weight loss and thus making her ineligible to join up. I know, fool proof plan, right?</p>

<p>What are your thoughts?</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Uncle Sam Tryin’ to Steal My Boo.</p></strong>


<p>Dear Uncle Sam Tryin’ to Steal My Boo,</p>
<p>Love’s a weird thing, isn’t it? Sometimes it makes us sound like the plot to an episode of “Malcom in the Middle” or “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia.” However, I can hardly suggest you go with this very Dennis Reynolds-sounding weight-loss scheme.</p>
<p>For starters, imagine the logistical difficulties you could run into with such a plan. It sounds like a tactical nightmare. How often are you going to be replacing the margarine with real butter? Won’t she notice when you order her a half-diet, half-regular Sprite? How many gyms can you get thrown out of without sacrificing your own fitness regimen?</p>
<p>All kidding aside, if you truly love and care about your girlfriend, you need to convince her to stay without using food-o-logical warfare. Your reasons for wanting to hold on to this relationship don’t justify driving a wedge into this woman’s life plans.</p>
<p>Have you told her that you love her? That you value your relationship? That you will be heartbroken when she leaves? Have you shown her you care? If your answer to these questions is a resounding “no,” then this is the place to start. You need to let her know how you feel, even if that’s difficult or painful.</p>
<p>If you have taken these steps already, then don’t put all your save-my-relationship eggs in the touchy-feely basket. If she plans on leaving regardless of the way you feel, then sabotage likely won’t change her mind.</p>
<p>I would suggest you make the most of the time you and your girlfriend have left together before some R. Lee Ermey-Full-Metal-Jacket type is asking to see her war face.</p>
<p>Live in the now — create memories that won’t require an Instagram post to reminisce about. Best case scenario, she realizes that your relationship is too good to give up for a military career. Worst case, she leaves, and you spend a few days planted on a bar stool ordering a series of drinks strong enough to make George Thorogood forget where he lives. At least you’ll know you made the best of it.</p>
<p>Don’t worry, you’ll be OK. This is usually where I would insert a couple clichés involving Shakespeare quotes or fish in the sea.</p>
<p>Without evoking the same tired phrases we rely on to make unrequited love seem less painful, I promise things will work out. If she leaves, you will find another woman. Who knows, she might have the blues at the same bar as you, sipping one bourbon, one scotch, one beer.</p>
<p>Hope this helps. Until next time, I remain</p>
<p>Your friend,</p>
<p>Dr. Kev</p>
