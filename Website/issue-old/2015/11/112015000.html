<p>On the corner of Third Street and Maria in Dayton’s Bluff, students from East Side High School plant a garden every summer with an array of vegetables. This lot in an urban neighborhood has not always been used to produce food, however. It  became available for gardening because of an explosion.</p>
<p>In July 1993, a fatal gas explosion decimated the area. The blast was powerful enough to toss a car across the street. A grocery store, bookstore and four apartments were reduced to rubble. As smoke billowed and flames shot out of the inferno, 70 firefighters worked tirelessly to contain it. Two people died on the scene and seven sustained injuries, though most apartment residents were evacuated in the 10 minutes between the puncturing of the gas main and the explosion.</p>
<p>As the area was rebuilt, Urban Roots, a nonprofit that creates opportunities for teens to gain job experience and develop entrepreneurial skills, partnered with the city of Saint Paul to turn the lot into a garden.</p>
<p>Urban Roots operates three main programs,  each functioning to hire low-income teens on the East Side and teach them job and life skills. Each summer, they hire around 60 teens, who work about 20 hours per week.</p>
<p>“For many of the teens, it’s their first summer job,” said interim executive director Glen Hill, noting that about 15 students continue to work with Urban Roots during the school year.</p>
<p>The Maria lot is one of six gardens maintained by Urban Roots. Others include plots owned by the Swede Hollow Café, Dellwood Gardens Assisted Living and a church. One plot is owned by a private resident who approached the organization to offer the use of his backyard.</p>
<p>“It’s a nice way to participate in the community,” Urban Roots Interim Director of Programming Patsy Noble said of their partners.</p>
<p>Although the area  of the six garden sites totals less than three-fourths of an acre, Urban Roots produced more than 8,000 pounds of food last year.</p>
<p>Food is the impetus behind the three main nature-based programs the teens work on: Market Gardening, the Conservation Corps and Cooking and Wellness. All three programs have community partners including area schools and businesses, as well as the city.</p>

<h2>Market Gardening</h2>
<p>The gardening program is not just about pulling weeds and otherwise digging in the dirt. Participants also learn the mechanics of all phases of the growing and production cycle including planting seeds, transplanting seedlings, controlling pests, and even harvesting and storing produce.</p>
<p>The students also have a say in how the gardens are designed. They choose crops to maximize production while also keeping the business side of agriculture in mind. For example, early maturing crops and late-season vegetables could use the same spot of land.</p>
<p>Interns at Urban Roots get hands-on experience outside of the garden as well. Market Garden interns had the opportunity to visit Izzy’s Ice Cream in Minneapolis this July. Izzy’s blended this year’s basil crop into their Lemon Basil Ice Cream. While taste testing the ice cream, they learned how local produce can be distributed to businesses in the area.</p>

<h2>Cooking and Wellness</h2>
<p>Cooking and Wellness interns learn about healthy cooking and nutrition through Urban Roots' programming. The Cooking and Wellness division caters and cooks for staff members and all 60 participants every week. The teens not only uses their own produce, but they develop their own recipes with guidance from the staff.</p>
<p>Another test of the teens' knowledge comes during the school year. The high school students teach fifth graders at J. J. Hill, Battle Creek and other East Side elementary schools.</p>
<p>The final way the teens integrate their work into the community is by actually going out and selling it to the public. The teens staff a booth at the Mill City Farmers Market and a cart at Target Field. At Target Field, they sell salads with homemade dressing, using recipes the interns have developed.</p>

<h2>Conservation Corps</h2>
<p>Students at Urban Roots improve the environment by restoring natural sites and removing invasive specie in area parks including the Bruce Vento Nature Sanctuary, Swede Hollow Park and Indian Mounds Park. They replace unwanted species like buckthorn with native plants such as milkweed, aster and hyssop. The Conservation Corps also works to restore shorelines, install rain gardens and build trails.</p>
<p>This summer, conservation interns participated in several citizen science projects. In one such project, they contributed data to the University of Minnesota’s Wasp Watchers program, which monitors the spread of the Emerald Ash Borer.</p>

<h2>Educational Components</h2>
<p>Obviously, a big reason for having a job is to earn money, but this program provides more than that. The teens at Urban Roots  have the opportunity to develop social and leadership skills, gain confidence in public speaking and learn how to be active team participants. “I think we see transformation in the youth very clearly,” Hill said. “For some, it’s very drastic.”</p>
<p>Hill and his team also realize that not every participant will end up working in the sustainable gardening and cooking realm. To that end, Urban Roots has an enrichment day each week to enhance participants’ financial literacy, work on building their resumes and explore post secondary education options.</p>
<p>They also bring in guest speakers to talk about careers and give teens a road map to achieve it. One Urban Roots alumni got his introduction to climate change and policy work from a guest speaker, according to Noble. His involvement continued at Saint John’s University — and now he’s going to the Paris Climate Change Conference.</p>

<h2>Urban Roots and Metropolitan State University</h2>
<p>Hill said they are also interested in working with Metropolitan State University to make use of the greenhouse on Maria Avenue, which has been closed down for a decade. The greenhouse would create more opportunities for teens over the winter. “It’s a great educational opportunity,” Hill said.</p>
<p>Metro’s interim President Devinder Malhotra has appointed a task force of community members and Metro faculty and staff to discuss possibilities for renovation and community use of this greenhouse.</p>
<p>“The purpose of this task force has been to help develop and create an operational plan how to renovate the greenhouse so it may be used for educational and community-related, i.e., healthy foods production, purposes,” said August Hoffman, a psychology professor at Metro.</p>
