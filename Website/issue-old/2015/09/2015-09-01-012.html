<p>While Metropolitan State University doesn’t have sports teams to welcome back for their first home game, that hasn’t stopped students from hosting nearly a week’s worth of events to celebrate the beginning of another semester.</p>
<p>“We kind of look at FallFest as our homecoming,” said Amber Hamm, President of Student Senate and a University Activities Board (UAB) employee. FallFest is organized by UAB and Student Life and Leadership Development. It runs from September 8 through September 13.</p>
<p>FallFest has been a long- standing tradition at Metro, andand 2015’s will be a year of firsts. For the first time, UAB has invited alumni from as far back as 1985 to attend the festivities this year- it’s the first time they’ve done this. Likewise, this year has an Outdoor Family Day, where students can get free tickets to Como Town for themselves and two guests.</p>
<p>The Campus Festival, which is intended to be the event’s climax, is scheduled for September 12. Metro’s student organizations will have events and activities for everyone to participate in. These groups have come up with a variety of entertainment options to draw students in. These include henna tattoos, caricatures, a dunk tank, a talent show and a bike-powered smoothie blender. DJs will provide the soundtrack, and food will be free and plentiful.</p>
<p>Metro’s atypical student population will have an opportunity to showcase their unique skills in a talent show. The semi-finals will be onare Wednesday, September 9, and the finals will beare during the Campus Festival on, September 12. Winners will get more than just bragging rights: first place wins $750, second earns $350, and third gets $150. UAB will judge the semi-finals, and the audience will decide the winners offor the finals.</p>
<p>Students attending FallFest will never be far from food; there will be on-campus barbeques on September 8, 9 and 10. Also, the “Dinner with the Leaders” event on September 11 will have food and a keynote speaker, Mohammad Zafar.</p>
<p>For FallFest, Metro in conjunction with Minneapolis Community and Technical College (MCTC), is hosting three days’ worth of live theater performances. Theater Underground will be performing the play “Sylvia” at MCTC’s Stagedoor Theater. Performances will be held from September 10 through 12, with the shows starting at 7 p.m. There will also be a matinee on September 12 at 2 p.m.</p>
<p>Fans of film will not be left out. On September 8 at 5 p.m. in the Founders Hall Auditorium, there will be a free showing of the movie Larry Crowne, starring Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts. Popcorn will be provided.</p>
<p>Students interested in community service will have the opportunity to volunteer with Habitat for Humanity ReStore on September 11. This aptly titled Day of Service is the result of a partnership between Metro’s Institute of Community Engagement and Scholarships and Student Senate. “It’s kind of like a Goodwill, but they only do home furnishings,” said Amber Hamm, UAB employee and President of Student Senate.</p>
