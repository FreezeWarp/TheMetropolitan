<p>Handshake is a new and user-friendly job search tool for students and alumni. Handshake, which launched this August, will be replacing CareerLink as Metropolitan State University’s careers service management platform. With Handshake, students and alumni can connect with employers and organizations looking to hire personnel from the growing Metro-educated workforce. Handshake, unlike CareerLink, has a user-friendly interface similar to that of common social media platforms such as Facebook and LinkedIn. But unlike said platforms, students do not receive unsolicited content from companies or organizations that have not been verified by Metro’s Career Center staff. Through the Career Center, all companies registering for Handshake will be vetted and confirmed to be reputable and trustworthy.</p>

<p>Handshake provides many features including:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A profile where you can save your resume, work history, external links (WordPress, Facebook, etc.) and academic projects to be viewed by potential employers and recruiters.</li>
  <li>Job Postings listed with both local and international businesses.</li>
  <li>Internship postings for a variety of fields.</li>
  <li>Notifications of local job fairs and other career-enhancing events.</li>
  <li>Informational articles and content recommended by the staff at Metro’s Career Center.</li>
  <li>Tailored Searches that students can use to refine search criteria to fit their interests, degree, location, employers, etc.</li>
  <li>Messaging options that students can use to communicate with other users and be contacted directly by prospective employers.</li>
  <li>The option to set up appointments with Career Center staff.</li>
</ol>

<p>Currently there are more than 330 employers on handshake. Employers will be able to search through student profiles for students with qualifications that meet their job criteria. This makes it easier to find  the candidates they need for any position.</p>
<p>Features like the planning tab allow students to keep track of their progress and provide counselors the information needed to give clearer recommendations for students’ academic and post-graduate future.
