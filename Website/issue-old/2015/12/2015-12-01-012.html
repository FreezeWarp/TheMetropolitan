<p>Life is too short to wait for it to come to you. You have to move, contemplate, ingest and digest. Life is not a game of hide and seek; life is a game of seek and find.</p>

<p>What do you want to do with the next year? The following three steps will help you achieve your goals in 2016.</p>


<h2>Step 1: Minimize</h2>
<p>This year, what things do you need to minimize? What activities have been taking up a lot of your time but you would like do less? Maybe you want to reduce the amount of time spent watching Netflix and television, or reduce the effort you put into your social media accounts.</p>


<h2>Step 2: Maximize</h2>
<p>What things must you spend more time pursuing in order to accomplish your goals? Let’s say you want to get into better physical condition. You should maximize the amount of time spent exercising and watching what you eat. It is that simple.</p>


<h2>Step 3: Exit</h2>
<p>Think of your life like an internet browser. Which tabs should you close? Sometimes you must choose to move on from the negative aspects of your life, whatever they may be. If something doesn't have redeeming value or isn’t adding to your life, do away with it. This might include habits that are no longer useful, friends that are holding you back or employment that isn’t satisfying.</p>

<p>If we do not exit certain tabs in our lives, we will be surrounded by unnecessary tabs that limit our potential. Don’t let your priorities get clouded by too many negatives. In short, get addicted to the future you; don’t take your future lightly.</p>
