<p>In case you hadn’t heard, the Metropolitan State University administration has been looking for a new dean of students. While that search has yet to find a long-term candidate, they know that the position is too valuable to be left vacant. So until that lengthy process begins again next year, Cecilia Stanton, with her qualified background and student-first approach, will fill in as interim dean of students.<br /> </p>
<p>The role is an important one that acts as liaison between students and campus resources. “I basically supervise several different areas within student services—cultural coordinators, student leadership, international services, veterans affairs, judicial affairs and TRiO,” explained Stanton. It involves “all of the student support that is not academic.”<br /></p>
<p>Where your advisor can get you on the right track to graduate in your program, Stanton and her team guide students to figure out all the other intricacies. “When a student comes in and says, ‘I need child care,’ we can connect them with the right resources in the community,” she said. It’s about helping students to get past “all of the little barriers that get in the way … to accomplish their goal of getting their degree.”<br /></p>
<p>While earning her own bachelor’s degree in psychology, Stanton got a jump-start on her own career. She was a first-generation college student at Bloomfield College, New Jersey, and had to work full-time in order to pay tuition. She started at the Assessment of Institutional Research Office, where she helped them to set up their first-ever institutional research library. “From that point on I was hooked on education,” she said.<br /></p>
<p>Born and raised in New York City, Stanton spent most of her collegiate and professional life on the East Coast. After Bloomfield College, Stanton’s mentor advised her that she should continue her education. She went on to Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Penn., to complete a pre-doctoral fellowship in cognitive psychology and attain her master of arts in sociology. <br /> It was in Pennsylvania that she began teaching, later getting involved in the development of a bridge program that helped new students adjust to college life. She was eventually promoted to assistant dean of multicultural affairs, then moved on to Colby College in Watterville, Maine, to be the associate dean of students.<br /></p>
<p>Several years ago, Stanton was recruited by Cappella University to be director of faculty, diversity and engagement, which is how she finally found herself in Minnesota. Here she was first introduced to a corporate higher education entity, devoted entirely to online learning. “Working there opened my eyes up to a whole new way of educating people.”<br /> Because of her background, Stanton understands how important it is to “be able to embrace online learning.” However, she also knows that online learning isn’t for everybody, and some classes just don’t fit that model. At Metropolitan State, where distance is often a huge barrier, her views might prove a perfect fit.<br /></p>
<p><strong>Working at Metropolitan State</strong><br /> Since taking the position almost three months ago, Stanton has been taking time to get to know as many people around campus as possible. She said, “You can’t, as an administrator, come up with policies, procedures, programs, that [are] going to fit everybody. You really have to understand the individual needs and then create programs.”<br /></p>
<p>This year Stanton will be working with Student Conduct Officer Jessica Focht-Perlberg to revise the student conduct code. “One of the things that the [Student] Senate brought up this year is the need to review that process and revise it, so that it really does support students as they go through that process,” she said. “So if you are brought up for a student code violation you still should get due process. We’re working to ensure that that process does that.” In other words, it gives the student a chance to explain their side of the story when they break the University’s code of conduct.<br /></p>
<p>Along with due process, Stanton emphasized the benefit of Focht-Perlberg’s approach to restorative justice. She said, “When someone does something wrong, it’s not just about slapping them on the hand and punishing them, it’s about helping them [to] figure out where they went wrong. … Understanding why they made that decision, and helping them to, in some way, right that wrong.” This process, she explained, could help students to develop ethical leadership that is necessary for them to succeed after they leave the University.<br /></p>
<p>The Student Life and Leadership Office is also under Stanton’s direction, and she has plans to lead efforts to implement a “more comprehensive leadership development strategy for our students.” She wants student organization leaders to “have opportunities to learn how to run a meeting, how to create a strategy … how to present yourself politically. Those skill sets are really needed, and we want to make sure that we are offering that.”<br /></p>
<p>And last, when asked about the poor student-to-advisor ratio, Stanton noted that approval had just been made to allow a student representative to sit on the advising council. This addition should help to keep advisors updated to what the students are saying. She said that “a listening session to better understand their experiences around the advising process” will now be implemented. Hopefully, with enrollment increasing (but not the budget), measures can be taken to relieve the stress of a stretched staff.<br /></p>
