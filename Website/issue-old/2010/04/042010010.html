<p>After attending the Undoing Racism workshop last November, Dorothy Thompson, Student Life and Leadership Development peer leader, decided more should be done to combat racism and discrimination. Instead of just talking about how discrimination should be stopped, Thompson decided to start a student group that will take action against discrimination and racism. <br /></p>
<p>Thompson has started the student group called Discriminology—Intergroup Dialogues. “I care very much for all people. I want to bring people together and provide a safe place where everyone is accepted and encouraged to reduce discrimination in their life,” she said about starting the group.<br /></p>
<p>The Undoing Racism workshop was instrumental in Thompson deciding to start this project. Rather than only focusing on one aspect of discrimination, such as racism, the group is interested in discussing all types of discrimination. <br /></p>
<p>The workshop taught individuals to recognize the need to educate others about discrimination. It also taught attendees that they are gatekeepers and they need to promote change in institutions (school, work, church). <br /></p>
<p>Everyone needs to find ways to promote diversity acceptance within those institutions. The Undoing Racism workshop taught attendees that diversity needs to be accepted and celebrated instead of just tolerated. <br /></p>
<p>The new Discriminology student group includes intergroup dialogues where issues of discrimination will be discussed and provide an opportunity for members to discuss ways that they can personally reduce discrimination at the school and in their own lives. Discussions in the meetings will allow different groups to explore issues of discrimination in order to break down barriers between groups. <br /></p>
<p>The new student group provides an opportunity for members who are interested in getting involved in the community to meet with others to work together on various projects. For example, one member of the group has decided to start a religious bible study group, which involves reading a variety of religious literature, instead of one book from one denomination.<br /></p>
<p>Group members receive a personal workbook to help them identify factors that have influenced their viewpoints about other groups and people. The workbook includes worksheets and a personality snapshot questionnaire to promote self-development. <br /></p>
<p>The group meets at the Midway campus, room 27, at 6 p.m. on following dates: March 25, April 8, April 22, May 13 and May 20 (more meetings will be scheduled during the summer months based on interest).<br /></p>
<p>Thompson believes this student group is needed because discrimination is occurring at Metropolitan State University, which has a diverse population. By providing an avenue for candid dialogue, people from different backgrounds (ethnicities, gender, sexual orientation, religion, age) have the opportunity to learn about others and themselves. <br /></p>
<p>Commenting on the need for the group, Thompson said, “We are socially constructed to think negatively about people who are different from us. We also come to conclusions about people who are different from us based on how they look, without knowing anything about them personally.”<br />Thompson believes that Metropolitan State will benefit from the formation of the group because open dialogue sessions will help reduce discrimination at the school and in the community. </p>
<p>Members will also become more aware of their own reasons for discriminating and they will learn more about other community members who they consider different. <br /> According to Thompson, “In order to reduce discrimination, individuals from diverse backgrounds need to be on the same page. If we don’t get together and work together, then everything is going to stay the same.”<br /> </p>
<p>Students interested in joining or learning more about Discriminology—Intergroup Dialogues, can contact Dorothy Thompson at thomdo@go.metrostate.edu or by calling (651) 793-1550.<br /> The Metropolitan would like to thank Student Life and Leadership Development Peer Leader Dorothy Thompson for her help with this article. </p>
