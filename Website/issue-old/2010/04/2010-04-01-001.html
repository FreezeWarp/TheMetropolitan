<p>Many corners of Metropolitan State University have been receiving extra attention lately. The most visible project was the resurfacing of the parking lot just east of the main building cluster. <br />Below the spiffy new blacktop is a modern drainage system designed to effectively redirect storm water runoff. </p>
<p>The $500,00 project was completed at the beginning of the school year. In the near future a sign will be erected highlighting the changes. The Metropolitan has covered this project in previous issues.</p>
<p>In Founders Hall, problems with the two elevators that began almost immediately after they were installed—more than a decade ago—are nearly resolved. The elevators were almost non-functional shortly after installation. “Dead on arrival,” is how Nancy Bagshaw-Reasoner describes them. <br /> Bagshaw-Reasoner is the facilities director for Metropolitan State. She has the enviable role of coordinating necessary or desirable improvements on campus with academic timelines, available funding and a host of other administrative concerns. <br /> </p>
<p>The previous elevator company went out of business years ago and parts became exceedingly scarce. When she came into the job two and one-half years ago, Bagshaw-Reasoner took one elevator offline, cannibalizing parts from one system in order to keep the other one working.<br /> I recently spoke about the repair work with members of All City Elevator, the company chosen to do the modernization. Jamie, one of the union workmen, gave me the short story on the elevator: “It’ll run better, a bit faster. And safely.” <br /> </p>
<p>I went to the hoist room for a more detailed explanation. This repair, called a “modernization,” calls for the elevator to be rebuilt on site. Only the car and the guide rails will remain in place. <br /> The machine that is responsible for the lifting–the 4,000-pound hoist–is removed and then replaced, followed by 5,000 pounds of counterweight. All of the controls are replaced and rewired, and the system’s operation is then tested. <br /> </p>
<p>Once it has been inspected and signed off on, the elevator will be put back into service. The first car should be running smoothly by the beginning of April. Then the process will be repeated on the second elevator. <br /> </p>
<p>Work on both systems should be completed by the end of spring semester, and Metropolitan State students and staff will be riding up and down Founders Hall at 250 feet per minute. <br /> Approximately $270,000 has been allocated for the repair through the Higher Education Asset Preservation and Renewal fund, known as HEAPR. This funding is administered by the governor and made available to Minnesota State Colleges and Universities (MnSCU) schools in order to protect public assets through building repairs and preservation, addressing air quality issues or code compliances.<br /> </p>
<p>In contrast to the Founders Hall modernization, the elevators in St. John’s Hall had a simpler upgrade performed this winter, completed in mid-January. These elevators had been fully operational, but the work done brought them into compliance with an updated safety code. The HEAPR fund had a $100,000 allocation for the St. John’s elevator upgrade, but the final cost was about $57,000, according to Bagshaw-Reasoner. All City Elevator won a competitive bidding process to perform the repairs, agreeing to pay employees the prevailing wage where they operate. <br /> </p>
<p>Jamie and the crew of All City workers said they enjoyed doing the work at Metropolitan State because the buildings are pretty small, but also because of the quiet environment. “Everybody is nice. Nobody complains.” <br /> </p>
<p>Over the course of the 14-week repair, the men have had plenty of opportunity to see how people react to the current situation. “People are so impatient. I’ve seen people press the button, wait two seconds, then go for the stairs. The elevator will open right as the [stairwell] door clicks shut.”<br /> </p>
<p>The main event of the spring for Founders Hall occupants is the continuing Gateway reorganization. The remodeling affects many of Metropolitan State’s staff and many student services, including admissions, registration, counseling and career services, disability services, TRiO: Student Support Services, the cultural and international student services and the dean of students. <br /> These offices are well used by the Metropolitan State community, and the new arrangements should improve students’ ability to access them. Notably, the disability services office has been moved to ground level, adjacent to the Founders Hall Auditorium. <br /></p>
<p>Instead of having to wind through the existing poorly functioning doorway and then having to go to the second floor, the new office is more easily approached through the westernmost set of doors. Speaking of the benefit to students with disabilities, Nancy Bagshaw-Reasoner said, “I figured if we could locate their counselors on the first floor, that would be better, especially with the [elevator] work.”<br /> </p>
<p>Bill Baldus, career counselor, is also getting a new location for his office. The old office was tucked in a corner behind the financial aid office. “Not ideal for student traffic,” according to Baldus. <br /> </p>
<p>Baldus is characteristically optimistic about the move, and says he is looking forward to the interactions that the new proximity to his collegues will bring.Baldus is also enthusiastic about having a dedicated career resource library, “a nice space for students to work on their career exploration and job searches. That experience can be kind of isolating,” he says. Baldus smiles broadly when he considers everything that has to be moved to the new locations: “It’s pretty awesome.” <br /></p>
<p>For years, the most pressing situation on the St. Paul campus had been the crumbling building between the Clark-King skyway and St. John’s Hall. The building is directly above Metropolitan State’s physical plant, which houses the heating and cooling apparatus for the entire campus. The demolition of the upper two floors must be accomplished while leaving the environmental systems for the campus intact and operational. <br /></p>
<p>These renovations have been worrisome for years. Even though the building is in danger of structural failure, Governor Pawlenty has repeatedly rejected an appropriation to remove the structure and replace it with a number of new classrooms and office space. <br /> Many people regard this new construction as a long-term cost savings, since it will ease the financial burden of leasing expensive classroom spaces off campus. Structural failure of the building would be hugely disruptive and incur many emergency costs. <br /> </p>
<p>Guided demolition has all the advantages of planning, including a predetermined timeframe. Apparently the Governor now agrees, having signed the Capital Investment Bill. In a forwarded e-mail sent out March 15, Metropolitan State President Sue Hammersmith related her excitement at the Governor’s reversal. <br /> </p>
<p>A grateful Hammersmith clearly savors the opportunity “to replace the last remaining—and condemned—part of the old St. John’s Hospital with a new state-of-the-art office and classroom facility.” <br /> </p>
<p>One estimate would see the new space ready to use in the spring of 2011. According to Bagshaw-Reasoner, the approved design could house 12 offices and seven classrooms, which would be available morning through night.</p>
