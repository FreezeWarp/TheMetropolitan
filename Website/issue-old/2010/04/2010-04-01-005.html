<p>Did you know that Metropolitan State University has complimentary issues of the New York Times available to students through the end of the 2010 spring semester? As remarkable as it is to have this benefit on campus, located outside the entry to the second-floor library entrance and near the Student Senate office, there are many available news sources to students if one knows where to look. <br /></p>
<p>One such place—a library—can be found in any school or community.A simple public library card can open a massive door of information with books, printed media, audio and visual media and Internet access. Along with the library, there are numerous Web sites one can access on a personal computer that provide important news articles from around the globe. <br /></p>
<p>The Internet has provided the globe with a necessary tool that can be used to open the world up to all. It is now easy to see that while one country finds a certain news piece important, another country’s focus can be on another issue. The following is an example of assorted headlines found among a few of the prominent global news Web sites from March 11, 2010: <br /></p>
<p>• The UK’s BBC’s headline: “New York agrees 9/11 dust payout” —regarding the money paid to rescue workers during the 9/11 cleanup. <br /> • The Middle East Al Jazeera headline: “New Chile President vows to rebuild”—regarding the newly elected leader and the recent earthquake efforts. <br /> • The Russian Pravda headline: “The French are glad to die for love”—regarding the marriage of French President Sarkozy. <br /></p>
<p>Many global regions’ headlines focused on news from another country and, although not all of the news sites reflected this path of reporting, many of them followed this route. The reason for this is unclear; however, it would be useful for a reader to investigate a news story within three or four different sources to determine the slant one reporter may have compared to another. <br /></p>
<p>One aggregate news source Web site that can be used for doing this is One World—Nations Online at www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/news.html. This link provides numerous news sites divided up by regions of the globe, where a person can get an in-depth look at a particular area, as well as what is happening locally. These sites can also be used to provide one region’s view of a national or world issue happening in another area. <br /></p>
<p>This does not necessarily make one news source right and another wrong. It can be agreed upon that, depending on which soil one stands, the view is different and the news affects each area and its citizens in a different way. Perspective makes each view correct or pertinent to the people of that particular land. It takes a critical eye and an open mind to distinguish between differing views—a skill that is beneficial in the many different careers students will be entering upon graduation. <br /></p>
<p>There are those who argue that holding a physical piece of paper or book is a feeling of connection and pleasure that cannot be found with the computer screen. However, there are times for work and there are times for pleasure.This world offers us ample choices of handheld, physical reading materials for a pleasurable sit with a cup of coffee or near a window with the setting sun as a backdrop. But when it comes to “getting the job done,” as in research, fact or fiction finding, homework or career projects, it is the Internet that allows for the greatest expanse and ease of information gathering. <br /></p>
<p>Although the Internet is not the only avenue to follow when gathering information, it is as equally relevant as books, newspapers or other physical resources. A few other Web sites that may be of interest are:<br /></p>
<p>• <a href="http://www.atimes.com">http://www.atimes.com</a> (an Asian news site)<br /> • <a href="http://global.nytimes.com">http://global.nytimes.com</a> (The New York Times online)<br /> •<a href="http://allafrica.com"> http://allafrica.com</a> (an African news source.)<br />•<a href="http://www.space.com"> http://www.space.com</a> (a site for news of the universe)</p>
