<p>On March 3, a friend and I attended Sample Night Live, a variety show of upcoming comedians, musicians, poets and artists, at the History Theatre in downtown St. Paul. The idea behind Sample Night Live is “to increase public awareness of the wide array of quality arts offerings in the Twin Cities…” by hosting a monthly show that highlights new performances and artists. <br /></p>
<p>The first Sample Night Live took place at Bryant-Lake Bowl in Minneapolis in 2008. Since December of that year, however, it has been held at the History Theatre in St. Paul. <br /></p>
<p>Each monthly show is comprised of two separate hour-long acts and a featured visual artist. The first act is G-rated and family-friendly, usually consisting of classical music, puppetry and a novelty act (such as magicians or escape artists).After intermission, the second unrated and uncensored act begins. <br /></p>
<p>Not being too interested in children’s theatre, I decided to attend only the second act. It began with an introduction by the evening’s host, a colorful persona who went by the name Lounge-asaurus Rex (in reality, comedian and improviser Tom Reed).Dressed in a satin, 70s-style shirt and wearing aviator sunglasses and a gold medallion, he immediately brought to mind the popular Ron Burgundy character played by Will Ferrell. <br /></p>
<p>Reed kept the show interactive by calling out winning ticket numbers and giving away art by the featured visual artist and tickets to performances, as well as introducing each new performer and bantering with the audience. <br /></p>
<p>Music from the Guthrie production Coward’s Women began Act Two with two risqué songs sung by Maud Hixson and Erin Schwab. Their voices were beautifully harmonious and decidedly reminiscent of the Ella Fitzgerald era. Coward’s Women was performed at the Guthrie Theatre from March 30-April 3. <br /></p>
<p>Following Coward’s Women was Alice Shindelar, member of the St. Paul Slam Team, who won the 2009 National Poetry Slam Competition. Shindelar performed her poetry (full of sexual innuendo and…ahem…shocking imagery—much to the delight of the audience) with her clear and captivating voice, transforming myself instantly into a slam poetry fan. If you’re interested in slam poetry, I highly recommend visiting the Artist’s Quarter in Minneapolis, who host an open mic night every Monday.<br /></p>
<p>The St. Paul music ensemble Zeitgeist performed next with the four members surrounding the piano onstage. One played the bass clarinet, one played the marimbas, one the piano keys and one played the piano strings itself. Other instruments included toilet brushes and Super Balls. Claiming their mission is to “enliven today’s music,” Zeitgeist definitely hosts unique instrumentation while creating hauntingly beautiful music full of discord and ominous sounds.

<p>The Adventures of Tim, Troy and Damian, an improvisational group with Comedy Sportz, filled the History Theatre with laughter as they turned an innocent trip to the zoo into criminal activity. Although young, these guys are obviously quick-witted and edgy enough that they were selected to open for Beatbox, a hip-hop improv comedy show in Minneapolis.

<p>The evening ended with music from Courtney McClean and the Dirty Curls, self-proclaimed “naughtybilly” music. Their raunchy and off-color lyrics (including confusing pregnancy for a beer-belly, and double entendres with the city of Moorhead) were set to an eclectic mix of bluegrass and power-rock, with the end result being catchy tunes that make you blush.

<p>At $20 per ticket, Sample Night Live isn’t the most affordable entertainment for college students. However, by reserving online with your St. Paul library card, students can reserve up to four free tickets at <a href="http://www.samplenightlive.com/sppl">www.samplenightlive.com/sppl</a>.
