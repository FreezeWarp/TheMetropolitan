<p>As a writer, I am always interested in what’s going on in the literary world, and poetry is no exception. When I found out Metropolitan State University was holding the Global Poetry Festival on the St. Paul campus, I had the opportunity to chat with Benjamin Bradley, Student Liaison to the Global Poetry Festival (GPF) to get the scoop on what it’s all about. <br /></p>
<p><strong>What is your Title?</strong><br /> My title is student liaison. I’ve been communicating with student associations, seeing who might be interested and willing to help. This role includes fund-raising, organizing their aid and trying to get word out about the GPF. <br /></p>
<p><strong>What is the Global Poetry Festival?</strong><br /> The Global Poetry Festival is a poetry event sponsored by Metropolitan State University. As it continues to establish itself, the GPF seeks to introduce the wide range of poetry found throughout the world and the poetry found within our own community. This year we will introduce a taste of spoken-word poetry, and we will be holding Metropolitan State’s very first poetry slam (visit the Web site listed below for more details on the slam format).<br /></p>
<p><strong>When and where will the Festival be held?</strong><br /> The Global Poetry festival will be held at Founder’s Hall, located on the St. Paul campus, on April 23 from 7 p.m.-10:30 p.m.<br /></p>
<p><strong>How many years has the Global Poetry Festival been active?</strong><br /> This will be the second Global Poetry Festival; however the years have not been consecutive. Depending on the success of this year’s event the GPF may become an annual event and something students can look forward to.<br /></p>
<p><strong>Why is this event important to Metropolitan State students, faculty and staff?</strong><br /> This event is connecting a creative community that doesn’t have a chance to speak out very often. This doesn’t just mean poets, but artists of all sorts. This is a creative outlet that students need. Faculty and staff can take this chance to see their students develop a creative identity for Metropolitan [State]. It will be an educational experience for both faculty and students.<br /></p>
<p><strong>How can people become involved?</strong><br /> Anyone interested can feel free to find us on Facebook, where they can stay updated and help us spread the word about the event.<br /></p>
<p><strong>What are the highlights of the Global Poetry Festival?</strong><br /> This year we are excited to host three members of the St. Paul 2009 National Championship Slam team as our feature act. The team, which consists of Kyle “Guante” Myhre, Khary “6-is-9” Jackson and Sierra Demulder, competed against 68 teams from around the world last year in order to become national champions. These three poets are truly incredible artists, and we are honored to have them. <br /></p>
<p>Also, we are proud to offer [the University’s] very first official poetry slam, where amateur poets will take part in a friendly competition after the feature act. In the following months we hope to find poets that represent the variety of people who reinforce the importance of poetry in today’s society. <br /></p>
<p>Along with this there will be an exhibit dedicated to written student poetry. There will be three poets who will read more traditional (not necessarily performance) poetry to open up the show. </p>
<p>DJ Trinidad will be keeping the event upbeat and there will be free food.<br /></p>
<p><strong>I am assuming you will have poets there. What kind of poetry can we expect to hear?</strong><br /> You will be hearing a more traditional type of poetry from our opening acts (three poets). The St. Paul Team consists of top-notch spoken word/performance artists. Poetry from the amateur poetry slam will follow certain rules. Their poems will be no more than three minutes, and three to five judges will rate the poets. For general poetry slam rules, you can visit this helpful website: www.poetryslam.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=10&amp;Itemid=25. We will be deciding on our own rules in the following weeks. <br /></p>
<p><strong>Why is poetry important to the Metropolitan State community?</strong><br /> What we’re looking to do is display the variety of poets found within the Twin Cities, like the 2009 St. Paul team, and the variety found within our own school. There’s a broad spectrum of poetry in today’s society—from traditional forms like the haiku, sonnet, etc., to radical forms that almost seek to break down the definition of poetry, all the way to stuff like spoken word and performance poetry that has evolved through the “beat generation” and the Black Arts Movement. <br /></p>
<p>So what we’re trying to do is give University students an idea of poetry in their own neighborhood. This poetry is what our community has to offer the world. In a way we just want to expose them to the kind of flavors they can see in their own community. And I think they’ll be surprised to see the differences from poet to poet. <br /> It’s a community that really doesn’t have a voice yet in Metropolitan [State]. We’re hoping to give them that needed voice. <br /></p>
<p><strong>Is there a fee to participate in or attend?</strong><br /> Students will go for free. We are considering charging a nominal fee for non-students, but nothing has been decided. <br /></p>
<p><strong>How did you become involved in the Global Poetry Festival?</strong><br /> The GPF committee stems out of Professor Ed Bok Lee’s class WRIT 599. I was first introduced to spoken word poetry when Ed came as a guest poet to Anoka Ramsey Community College, where I used to attend. I was blown away by this style of poetry. When I came to Metropolitan [State], I couldn’t pass up taking a class where Ed helps his students examine poetry in today’s society and where it fits. <br /></p>
<p><strong>Is there any additional information you would like to share about the Global Poetry Festival?</strong><br /> The Global Poetry Festival is co-sponsored by the Muslim Student Organization, Women Empowered, the Student Senate and the equal opportunity and diversity office. We also received generous donations from SAFAC. We thank them for their participation in this event.<br /></p>
<p>The theme of our event is Connecting Voices, Shaking Earth, and it will serve as an outlet for Metropolitan [State] students to get to know their community as well as better understand the variety of poetry that can be found within the Twin Cities. <br /></p>
<p><strong>Closing thoughts?</strong><br /> This event is going to be awesome.<br /></p>
