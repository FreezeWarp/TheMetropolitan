<p>Due to the economic climate and a tendency for people to return to school when job opportunities are thin, many higher education institutions have seen a grand increase in enrollment in the last year. <br /></p>
<p>While society as a whole can stand to benefit from having such a well-educated population, there are financial obligations that need to be addressed before that gain can be realized.</p>
<p>Currently the state legislature, already facing nearly $1 billion in debt, is struggling to find a way to maintain finances for Minnesota universities. With Metropolitan State University bursting at the seams after a year that saw enrollment increase more than 10 percent, it’s pretty clear that more money will be required.<br /></p>
<p>But the fact is that Metropolitan State is preparing for a cut in funding of at least $10.5 million. More students, less money… higher tuition.<br /></p>
<p><strong>Students in action</strong><br /> Despite the state’s financial woes, there are a couple of active students that find it short-sighted to skimp on higher education—and they’re willing to take their voices straight to the policy makers.<br /></p>
<p>“It’s so counter-productive for our state to limit students’ ability to attend college,” said senior Clara Ware, Metropolitan State senator and one of several members of the University’s Student Senate that attended Lobby Day on March 3, 2010. She continued, “It’s bad, and I’m worried about the impact.”<br /></p>
<p>The impact, according to Minnesota State Colleges and Universities (MnSCU), could be as much as a 12 to 15 percent increase in tuition in the coming years.<br /></p>
<p>Ciara Kilbride Amaral, Metropolitan State chair of the legislative committee and student senator, scheduled nine appointments with state senators and representatives to discuss the shortfalls of underfunding higher education. Throughout the meetings, the group addressed issues at Metropolitan State, like the lack of expert advice from the financial aid department, a poor student-to-advisor ratio and delayed graduations caused by filled-to-capacity classes. <br /></p>
<p><strong>What’s the response?</strong><br /> Despite having control of both the Minnesota House of Representatives and Senate, Democrats (who are most in favor of funding higher education fully) are struggling to get around Republican Governor Tim Pawlenty and his veto power. The struggle to manage the deficit and provide adequate services to the people is nothing new, but in what the Chair of the House of Higher Education committee, Tom Rukavina, calls “the brain state,” the outlook is bleak. “You can only cut so much before you really start to hurt people,” said Rukavina. <br /></p>
<p>His solution: raise taxes. “Elect a governor with the guts to raise money,” he said, “[and] dedicate some to higher education.”<br /></p>
<p>Senator Sandy Pappas, who also chairs for the Senate Higher Education Budget Division, agrees with Rukavina that the solution is a couple of years out, when the state starts its election processes anew. “[We can] raise $3 billion with a new governor,” she said.<br /></p>
<p>While the mood with Pappas and Rukavina was grim, frustration and tension was high in a meeting with Senator Scott Dibble. He mentioned that the two parties now have such a “profoundly different perspective” that it makes it impossible for anything to get done. He reaffirmed the Republicans’ status as “the party of no,” and stressed the importance of the people to “engage the candidates at election time.”<br /></p>
<p><strong>What can you do?</strong><br /> Amaral, who took “point” (where the student begins the discussion and is responsible to help carry the conversation) in many of the meetings, judged the day a success. But without really having acquired anything physical, how can this be?<br /></p>
<p>According to Amaral, “When we ask the legislators ‘What can we do?’ and they reply ‘Nothing,’ that’s a failure.” She mentioned success in terms of being able to raise awareness and engage the students. Jahan Powell, Metropolitan State legislative committee member and student senator, said, “If you engage the legislators, and if they connect with your stories, that’s a success.”<br /> Not a single legislator answered “Nothing,” and a group of well-versed and informed students got their stories heard. Success.<br /></p>
<p><strong>New classroom center approved</strong><br /> Two days after Lobby Day, this reporter heard from Ware that Metropolitan State was approved by the Higher Education Committee for one of its two bonding requests. More recently, the measure passed the state Senate and, finally, the governor for final approval.<br /></p>
<p>The new classroom center, located on the St. Paul Campus, will “support science, technology, engineering and math initiatives through expansion of high-quality instructional space,” according to the MnSCU budget request. The center will be built next to St. John’s Hall, where currently a condemned building sits atop an energy plant.</p>
