<p>Type in almost any subject into a search engine and chances are that the topic’s Wikipedia entry is in the top few search results. Clicking on the link takes you to what seems like an informational goldmine of facts and figures, a one-stop shop for any research project or paper. So why, when you receive the instructions for a research project, does your instructor probably tell you that Wikipedia is not to be cited as a research source?<br /></p>
<p>Wikipedia, which was started in January 2001 by Lawrence Sanger and James Wales as an adjunct to the now-defunct, professionally written and researched Nupedia, offers much as a research tool. It’s free, it’s up-to-date (the page on the Virginia Tech Massacre evolved even as the situation unfolded) and it’s expansive, with more than 14 million articles in at least 10 languages and more than 3.2 million articles in the English-language Wikipedia alone. <br /></p>
<p>With a volunteer staff of thousands of editors and writers, and their diverse backgrounds, interests and educations, Wikipedia offers a reader articles on topics as varied as oak trees, the origin of swear words, George Washington, the 2010 Haiti earthquake and the Call of Duty video game franchise.<br /></p>
<p>With all that’s going for it, why are students told not to cite the site as a research source?<br /></p>
<p>Initially, one of its great strengths—the ability of anyone to write or edit an article—is also one of its main weaknesses. With no verification of who is writing the article or their qualifications, a reader is left to take the information at face value and hope that Wikipedia’s other editors have shaped the article into a fair, accurate topic.<br /></p>
<p>Besides this key factor, Wikipedia has been subject to numerous scandals and acts of vandalism, some of which include:<br /></p>
<li>In 2005, the article on journalist John Seigenthaler Sr. was vandalized, when text saying that Seigenthaler was a suspect in both the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and his brother, Attorney General Robert Kennedy, was inserted into his biography. The text was not corrected for four months, after which Wikipedia instituted a number of reforms and policy changes including barring anonymous users from writing new articles and a stricter policy on the biographies of living people, tagging them for further review.<br /></li>
<li>In 2006, several United States Congressional staffers were caught editing the pages of their bosses by removing unfavorable information, adding positive information or completely redoing the page with content authored by the Congressional staffer. These staffers were also editing the pages of their opponents to add negative information. Some of those involved were from the offices of Norm Coleman and Gil Gutknecht, both having pages edited to appear more favorable. <br /></li>
<li>In 2007, a scandal broke out that revealed a paid employee and administrator named “Essjay,” who claimed to have doctorate degrees in theology and canon law and was a tenured professor at a private university, was, in reality, a 24-year-old community college drop out. “Essjay” had used his fake credentials in disputes with other Wikipedia contributors over content.<br /></li>
<li>In 2009, Wikipedia had to block Internet provider addresses from the Church of Scientology to prevent self-serving edits to their articles, and they banned a number of anti-Scientology users from editing Scientology-related articles after a back-and-forth war of edit and counter-edit.<br /></li>
<p>Wikipedia has enacted a number of changes to their policy to reduce or prevent similar occasions in the future. That said, is there any reason to use Wikipedia in research at all? Yes. Wikipedia’s main strengths are the same as a regular paper encyclopedia—a quick reference to give a reader some background information on a topic and point them towards other, more definitive sources.In Wikipedia’s case, the vast majority of articles have external links to other sites as well as a collection of footnotes for further research. It’s these footnotes and external links that should be cited as sources in research.<br /></p>
<p>Or as founder James Wales said in a Time interview from March 2007, “The site is a wonderful starting point for research. But it’s only a starting point because there’s always a chance that there’s something wrong, and you should check your sources if you are writing a paper.” (In the interest of full disclosure, Wikipedia was used in the research for this article.)<br /></p>
