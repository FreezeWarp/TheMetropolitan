<p>If you spend some time getting to know your fellow students at Metropolitan State University, you find that they have a wide range of hobbies and pasttimes. Some are into sports, cars or nature—the list of interests is endless and varied. And if you’ve ever taken a class with Dana Freiberg and gotten to know her just a little bit, you probably think of her as being quiet and understated. <br /></p>
<p>That is just one side of Freiberg. By day, she is a self-described “oracle minion” at Met Council, and in the evenings, a dedicated student. But in her free time, she is a competitive bagpiper. She gained an interest in piping through her boyfriend, another bagpiper. Freiberg wanted to learn,and after making a fair amount of phone calls to find a teacher, got started with it eight years ago.<br /> She is a member of two pipe bands, most notably the St. Andrews Society Pipe Band of Winnipeg, a grade-two band based in Manitoba (in the world of piping, there are five grades, or categories, with grade one being the highest level). The St. Andrews group consists of 22 pipers, eight snares, four tenors and a bass. <br /></p>
<p>The group performs traditional Scottish tunes and modern Canadian pipe music, and in February they won the indoor competition at the Winnipeg Scottish Festival. For multiple years in a row, they have also won the North American Pipe Band Championships in Maxville, Ontario. In August 2010, they will be traveling to Scotland to compete with 8,000 other pipers at the World Pipe Band Championships 2010 in Glasgow. <br /></p>
<p>Between St. Andrews and the local group to which she belongs, Dana performs 12 or more times during the year, mostly during the months when weather permits outdoor piping (generally from May through early September). With her bagpipes, she has performed at numerous competitions in eastern and central Canada and also here in the Midwest region.<br /> In addition to competitions, she has also played for weddings, funerals and even once onstage with Jefferson Starship at the Fitzgerald Theater in St. Paul. For the last four years, she has piped for dancers at the Renaissance Festival in Shakopee. <br /></p>
<p>As for the time she spends at Metropolitan State, Dana is working toward a Bachelor of Applied Science in computer forensics, to supplement a bachelor’s degree in criminal justice that she holds from Bemidji State University. She works toward her computer forensics degree by taking two classes per term and expects to complete her degree in 2011.</p>
