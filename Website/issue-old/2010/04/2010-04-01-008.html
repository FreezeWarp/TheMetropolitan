<p>Most people think of Easter, rainy days or pulling pranks for the month of April. A large majority is reminded of their tax deadline. Those responsible for the tuition, though, begin to think of financial aid. <br /> </p>
<p>For the 2009-10 academic year, tuition at Metropolitan State University is $177.15 per credit and $10.43 in additional fees per credit. Therefore, a student taking 12 credits owes the University $2,250.96. A student who owes $500 per month in rent will need an additional $4,500 for the nine-month school year, as well as paying for textbooks, which can range from $100-$1,000. <br /> </p>
<p>While these aren’t extraordinarily high numbers (the University of St. Thomas, for instance, charges an incredible $936 per credit, while the University of Minnesota charges $350.76 per credit), students continue to struggle with cost. <br /> </p>
<p>Factors not normally considered are called into question when students try to find money for tuition. “Can I go to school and afford daycare?” “Do I need to sell my iPod or computer to make rent this month?” <br /> </p>
<p>In my never-ending search for free money I’ve come across a variety of financial aid websites.I also have a system I follow that keeps me on track and keeps me enrolled. <br /> </p>
<p><strong>Fill out your FAFSA</strong><br /> The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is used to calculate the amount of money a family is expected to contribute (for students under the age of 25), which means this determines how much financial aid each student will receive. This is the first step to getting free money, and the best part is that it’s completely free and easy to fill out. <br /> </p>
<p>You will need your completed tax documents (and your parent’s tax documents if you’re under 25), your school code (Metropolitan State University is 010374) and your PIN number, which you apply for before you fill out your FAFSA. For more information and help on filling out the form, visit www.fafsa.ed.gov or call the University financial aid office at (651) 793-1414.<br /> </p>
<p><strong>Apply for grants</strong><br /> Filling out the FAFSA is also the first step in applying for grants. After your financial data is analyzed, the University is informed of any grants you qualify for. The Minnesota State Grant is offered to low- and moderate-income families and the Federal Pell Grant is offered to families with income up to $60,000.<br /> </p>
<p><strong>Search for scholarships</strong><br /> The best website I’ve found so far is www.fastweb.com. Fastweb tailors scholarships to your specific university, major, g.p.a., gender, ethnicity, interests and hobbies, which result in a wide range of available scholarships to choose from. <br /> </p>
<p>Students also have access to over $150,000 in privately funded scholarships from Metropolitan State. The financial aid website, <a href="http://www.metrostate.edu/msweb/pathway/aid/grants_loans_scholar/scholarships.cfm">www.metrostate.edu/msweb/pathway/aid/grants_loans_scholar/scholarships.cfm</a>, contains application forms and deadline information. <br /> </p>
<p>Scholarships are also available for students depending on their ethnicity. Latino students can find valuable information with Latino College Dollars (www.latinocollegedollars.org) and with The Hispanic Scholarship Fund (www.hsf.net). African-American students are eligible for scholarships with Little Africa (www.littleafrica.com/scholarship) and the United Negro College Fund (www.uncf.org). Muslim students can benefit from the blog Scholarship for Muslim Students, at http://muslimscholarships.blogspot.com. Asian-American students can find scholarships at http://uspaacc.com/index.php/programs/college-scholarships, while Native Americans can find scholarships at www.indianeducation.spps.org/Scholarship_Information.html. The point is that there are thousands of scholarships available for Minnesota minorities. <br /> </p>
<p><strong>Apply for a loan</strong><br /> Although student loans are the least desirable method of paying for college because of interest rates and the complexity of the application process, they are sometimes necessary. The University now participates in the Direct Federal Student Loan program as well as the state’s Student Educational Loan Fund (SELF) program, a long-term, low-interest educational loan financed through the sale of revenue bonds. <br /> </p>
<p>Students can also apply for private student loans, which are based solely on credit, not financial need. If students have a negative credit history or no credit history at all, they will need to have a cosigner with a good credit rating. Lenders include Wells Fargo Bank, EdAmerica and CitiBank, among others. Students should compare interest rates and repayment schedules when choosing a lender. <br /> </p>
