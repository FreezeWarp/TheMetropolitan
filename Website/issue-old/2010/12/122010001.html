<p>“Change” was the theme of Barack Obama’s  presidential campaign in 2008, which also came with promises of increased  transparency in government. On election day last month, American voters  responded to PresidentObama and the Democrat-controlled Congress with  their own form of change.<br />  </p>
<p>With a margin not seen in Washington in  decades, voters around the country returned control of the U.S. House of  Representatives to Republicans and gave the GOP six additional seats in the  U.S. Senate, including a number of first-time candidates.</p>
<p>Big changes are also coming to the Minnesota  state capitol as voters across the state turned over control of both houses of  the legislature to Republicans, something Minnesota has not seen in several  generations. Is this all a result of the Tea Party movement?<br />  </p>
<p>In two words: not exactly.<br />  </p>
<p><strong>He saw it coming</strong><br /> In his 1995 book, <em>The Vision of the Anointed: Self-Congratulation as a  Basis for Social Policy</em>, Stanford  University economics scholar Dr. Thomas Sowell foresaw leftist and socialist  political candidates campaigning on a nebulous theme of change and then  imposing their policies once actually taking office. In 2008, Barack Obama won  the presidency and then acted in precisely this manner, with predictable  results.<br />  </p>
<p>Since President Obama took office 22 months  ago, Americans have witnessed soaring government spending that has pushed the  United States deeper into debt, endangering the country’s long-term fiscal  viability. <br />  </p>
<p>Among President Obama’s major  initiatives is the now-unpopular health care legislation widely known as  “ObamaCare,” which sets the table for a government seizure of nearly one-sixth  of the economy and is seen by many legal scholars as being unconstitutional. <br /> Together with President Obama’s economic  stimulus program, the resulting unemployment rate has soared to 9.6 percent as  of press time, up from less than 8 percent when President Obama took office.<br />  </p>
<p><strong>Hit the road, Jack</strong><br /> As a result, voters turned Democrats out of  many congressional and state offices across the country <em>en masse</em>.  But most Republicans are not exactly giddy  with excitement right now. <br /> St. Cloud State University economics  professor King Banaian, Ph.D, a Republican candidate awaiting a recount,  cautions that while many people see the election as a mass rejection of the  Obama agenda, he feels it is simpler than that.<br />  </p>
<p>“This is a case where the Obama  administration over-promised and under-delivered. Barack Obama campaigned on  transparency in government, but you cannot have transparency in a 2,300-page  health care bill or a 1,300-page financial overhaul bill and then leave them  for partisans and bureaucrats to interpret later.” Dr. Banaian’s advice for new  office-holders also takes a sober tone.<br />  </p>
<p>“The United States isn’t really crawling  with rock-ribbed Reagan conservatives right now. Basically, Republicans are on  probation; voters are saying, ‘If you screw this one up, you could be in the  minority for generations to come.’ And I see most Republicans buying into  this.”<br />  </p>
<p><strong>“a Ponzi scheme…”</strong><br /> Political differences aside, Dr. Banaian’s  assessment of ObamaCare is short and straightforward. Under the plan, more and  more employees at businesses small to large should expect to pay much higher  premiums, such as is happening at Boeing Corp., or lose their corporate health  care plans entirely. <br /> “ObamaCare has nothing that reduces the cost  of health care. Many businesses simply won’t offer health insurance anymore  because even after paying the fines and penalties; it will cost them less money  in the end,” Banaian says.<br />  </p>
<p>What about allowing Americans to purchase  health insurance across state lines, the way we can purchase automobile  insurance?  “That’s an easy, simple solution  that works; it makes an enormous amount of sense,” said Dr. Banaian. In the  legislature, we can look at that. Now, the Federal Department of Health and  Human Services (HHS) might try to sue us, but I would like to explore whether  or not we can pass this sort of law.” <br />  </p>
<p>President Obama’s spending increases, if  left unchecked, are likely to cause enormous fiscal problems for the  government, says the professor. “As the debt-to-GDP ratio hits 90 percent, you  basically hit a wall. I think the debt service costs will squeeze out a lot of  discretionary spending, cutting off many programs and really hurting  Americans.”<br />  </p>
<p>“The election results are partly a reaction  to the size of the debt,” Banaian continues. “You cannot run government as a  Ponzi scheme. You have to have some credibility or it will result in an even  worse economic slowdown. I expect the spending proposals from the state House  this coming term will be much more disciplined and that we will live within our  means.”<br />  </p>
<p><strong>You want a tight race?</strong><br /> The gubernatorial race between Democrat Mark  Dayton and Republican Tom Emmer has had to go to a recount, but that’s nothing  compared to the excruciatingly tight race for the state house in District 15B.  Prof. Banaian and well-known Democrat Carol Lewis are headed for a recount in  which Banaian’s lead is a mere 10 votes. <br />  </p>
<p>The professor told <em>The Metropolitan</em> that he is certain that the recount will confirm his margin and that he  will win, but he is also looking ahead toward how he’ll be serving his constituents.<br /> “When you win by so few votes, you have to  make sure you communicate twice as hard so the voters know who they’ve chosen.  You need to send clear signals that you got the message.”<br />  </p>
<p><strong>Thirty-four is enough</strong><br /> One of the most stunning Republican  victories on Nov. 2 came in northern and eastern Minnesota, where voters  removed 34-year incumbent Democrat James Oberstar from office, sending retired  U.S. Navy and Northwest Airlines pilot Chip Cravaack to Washington to represent  Minnesota’s 8th Congressional District instead.<br />  </p>
<p>Even in the governor’s race, where Dayton  appears to have won over Emmer and third-party candidate Tom Horner pending a  recount, it is rumored that Republicans in the legislature may not give Mr.  Dayton the chance to fulfill his promise to raise taxes on owners of small  businesses and wealthier residents, at least without Dayton risking a state  government shutdown or other unpopular impasse.<br />  </p>
<p><strong>Education still a big issue</strong><br /> First-time candidate Mark Fotsch was one of  the few Minnesota Republicans who came out on the short end of the vote, a  60-40 result in the heavily Democrat-leaning District 54A covering Roseville  and St. Anthony. Eighteen-year incumbent Democrat Mindy Greiling hung onto her  state house seat, but nevertheless, Fotsch sees day-to-day problems with  Greiling’s education spending policies in his own area.<br />  </p>
<p>“My oldest son starts school next year and  Mindy’s decisions to reduce my options for my son’s education have resulted in lower  school standards, schools closing and increased class sizes. We parents and  taxpayers deserve a better response from our public schools. Our future is  education and the current direction is failing,” Fotsch said.<br />  </p>
<p>In fact, Fotsch had not even intended to be  a candidate for office, but he says he will challenge Greiling again in 2012.<br />  </p>
<p>Perhaps as a relevant springboard from his  teaching post at St. Cloud State University, Dr. Banaian also said that he  intends to be on the house higher education committee. “I expect to be doing a  lot of things regarding Minnesota State Colleges and Universities (MnSCU),” the  professor said.<br />  </p>
<p><strong>The final score</strong><br /> Whether or not politicians in Washington and  St. Paul were listening before election day, voters spoke loud and clear. Dr.  Banaian summed up the new and markedly different political landscape quite  humorously: “This kind of change comes around only about as often as Halley’s  Comet.”</p>
