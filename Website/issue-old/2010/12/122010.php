	<p>“Change” was the theme of Barack Obama’s  presidential campaign in 2008, which also came with promises of increased  transparency in government. On election day last month, American voters  responded to PresidentObama and the Democrat-controlled Congress with  their own form of change.<br />  </p>
	<p>With a margin not seen in Washington in  decades, voters around the country returned control of the U.S. House of  Representatives to Republicans and gave the GOP six additional seats in the  U.S. Senate, including a number of first-time candidates.</p>
	<p>Big changes are also coming to the Minnesota  state capitol as voters across the state turned over control of both houses of  the legislature to Republicans, something Minnesota has not seen in several  generations. Is this all a result of the Tea Party movement?<br />  </p>
