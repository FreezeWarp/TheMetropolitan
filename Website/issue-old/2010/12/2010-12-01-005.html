<p>So here I am: a year and a  half after I started my first class at Metropolitan State University. It’s been  a wild ride and as much as I’m ready to move on to the next phase of my life,  there are definitely some people, classes and events that will be branded into  my brain for years to come. Maybe someday I’ll write a book about it.<br /> </p>
<p>Apart from the practical academic skills  that Metropolitan State has given me, I’ve had the reward of experiencing a lot  of personal growth during the time that I’ve been here. I started school  restless, hating my job but not knowing other options, still mourning the death  of my mother less than a year before.<br /> </p>
<p>Last spring, armed with real-world knowledge  of how the writing and publishing industries work, I decided where I wanted to  work, <em>Experience Life</em> magazine, a health and fitness magazine that I’ve  read and loved since almost its beginning. <br /> </p>
<p>The magazine represents the healthy living  that I want to commit myself to and I knew that I just <em>had</em> to be a  part of the amazing team that puts it together. I set out on a mission to make  myself known to the staff and secured an internship this summer. <br /> </p>
<p>I’m happy to say that I was offered a  position as an associate editor at the magazine last month. I will say that a  lot of what got me here is hard work and perseverance, but all the people I’ve  met and classes I’ve taken at Metropolitan State gave me the skills and  confidence to pursue what I wanted—something I wasn’t able to do before I  started this journey.<br /> </p>
<p>To those of you who will be back in the new  year: hang in there. Use this time to the best of your ability to determine  what you want, not just for a career but out of life in general. Trust in  yourself and trust that your hard work will pay off in the long term.<br /> </p>
<p>I leave you in the hands of <em>The Metropolitan’s</em> new editor-in-chief, Randi Johnson, a far more capable editor than I’ve  ever been. She is a talented and creative writer, editor and designer, and has  some great ideas to improve the paper. I wish her luck and look forward to  seeing the evolution.<br /> </p>
<p><strong>For everyone I know and those I wish I’d  met, have a happy holiday season and keep up the good fight!</strong></p>
