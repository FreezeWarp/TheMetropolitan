<p>At the Student Veterans of  American conference (SVA), not only were we scouting the organization to  determine if we should join, but we were there to learn information about what  is being done for the advocacy of student veterans on a national level. I pleasantly  surprised, in fact I would go as far as to say I was astounded. <br /> </p>
<p>SVA is a non-profit organization run and  maintained by veteran students from all over the country on a volunteer basis.  They are absolutely amazing, essentially the same group with the same goals and  ambitions as the Metropolitan State University Veterans Network, but on a  national level. <br /> </p>
<p>That being said, let me jump into the  conference and what was learned from that. The first day we gathered for dinner  and met one another, and we did volunteer work making up bags of books and  crayons for underprivileged children in the Washington, D.C. area. <br /> </p>
<p>The second day was the best. We heard from  speakers including Ray Jefferson, the assistant secretary of the Department of  Labor, who talked about what is being done to help veterans get back in the  work place after serving their country. <br /> </p>
<p>We also heard from the Secretary of Veterans  Affairs Eric Shinseki, who talked about all the ideas and projects the Veterans  Administration (VA) has begun to implement for helping veterans of all eras. <br /> </p>
<p>Throughout the day there were breakout  sessions where we were taught and trained in different areas like media  relations, preparing for a rewarding career and—my favorite—mental health and  transitioning wounded veterans. There was also an exhibition and career expo  where we could connect with veteran-friendly employers and other organizations  that had been helping with the reintegration process of returning veterans. <br /> </p>
<p>On day we actually got to bring our comments  and concerns to light by having a Q &amp; A panel with representatives from  Veteran Affairs, the American Legion, American Council on Education, the  president of Georgetown University and Senator Chuck Hagel, who helped create  the post-9/11 G.I. Bill. <br /> </p>
<p>What we brought back to the school is a new  wealth of knowledge on many of the issues our student veteran or non-veteran  student body might be facing or struggling with. I am also now equipped with a  vast network of resources that can be tapped into to better serve our  ever-growing veteran population here at Metropolitan State. <br /> </p>
<p>I feel extremely blessed and privileged to  have been able to attend the conference and see some astounding monuments that,  as a veteran, I hold dear to my heart. I plan on paying back the trip by taking  everything I have learned to help sustain, to the best of my ability, the  wonderful community we have here at Metropolitan State.</p>
