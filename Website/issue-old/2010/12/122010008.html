<p>I once heard that the  true test of self examination is survival. I despise the people who say, “Oh, I  wouldn’t change a thing.”  If I were to  take an honest journey down memory lane, it would not be an altogether pleasant  experience. <br /> </p>
<p>There are of course instances when I  knew I was making a mistake but made it anyway. There was peer pressure, lack  of self-control, the mean streak of a young girl and the insecurities of a  young woman. There was all of this, these reasons why I could have, sometimes should  have, been in more trouble. Then to save me, there was Jesse.<br /> </p>
<p>My first memory of Jesse is of him catching  me lighting matches in my room. For my own protection and the guaranteed exodus  of said matches, he lit each one. Methodically he let each burn down to his  fingertip, letting out the standard cuss words of an eight-year-old boy when  the sting of the burn hit him. <br /> </p>
<p>When he finally got to the last one,  he decided to experiment with my rug and the match this resulted in a fire that  raged to heights over my small four year old head. When my mom finally put out  the fire and asked what had happened, Jesse didn’t narc me out. Later in life,  he would retell how he had saved me from a fire comparable to that of a  2,000-acre forest! In the end, his result was disastrous, but his intent was of  simple brotherly concern. <br /> </p>
<p>When I began kindergarten, Jesse pedaled his  bike tediously, slowing so my small legs could keep up down our mile long  driveway for the bus. He walked me to class every day and endured the torture  of his peers as he waited outside my classroom at the end of each day. <br /> </p>
<p>Always Jesse rode that bike with the  sweat of his conflicting emotions rolling down his neck.  To feel the wind in his hair or wait for the  bike with the lopsided training wheels and pink hearts. His conscience almost  always won out.  <br /> </p>
<p>As we got older, Jesse became pretty popular  and he learned to play it cool. He didn’t wait for me after class or hardly  give me the time of day, but if some one picked on one of his siblings—he was  there. To be sure, we didn’t always get along; there were screaming matches and  there were wrestling matches, but there was always a strict loyalty to family. <br /> </p>
<p>Looking back I feel sorry for the boy  who was a father to his 5 siblings. Jesse had no one to guide him; no one to  protect him he had to learn everything the hard way. I think this is why he  worked so hard to protect us. <br /> </p>
<p>Jesse gave us more advice than any kid  could possibly want and every time we made a mistake he sat us down and gave  the patriarchal lecture. He gave us all the options, encouraged our decisions  but never forced his opinion.  <br /> </p>
<p>When we were in high school I definitely  went through a lot of those times I wish I could change. I hung out with older  kids, partied, drank, skipped school and so much more that I could never put  into written word and claim. After every mess I got myself in, Jesse would  patiently counsel me. <br /> </p>
<p>I suppose Jesse was trying to make me  see the light, he tried to set a good example and gave up a lot of his own  vices, hoping I would follow suit.   Eventually, Jesse’s persistence paid off and I learned to take school  seriously, to make better decisions and to treat myself and others with  respect. I give Jesse credit for saving me from myself.  <br /> </p>
<p>On a dark rainy night, Jesse and I sat up  until four in the morning. One of his best friends had died in a car accident  and Jesse couldn’t sleep. We sat on the couch watching movie after movie in an  endless silence, each of our minds spinning. This was one of the few times I  remember my brother crying; he wasn’t ashamed to miss someone so much it hurt. <br /> </p>
<p>We talked a lot that night about what  would happen if one of us were to die and the way kids do—we agreed upon final  words, songs and memories to be shared. When Jesse finally fell asleep, he  rolled over on my tiny eight-pound puppy and by the time he realized it, he  thought for sure he had suffocated it. <br /> </p>
<p>Jesse handed me the dog, bawling,  saying how sorry he was. Biting my tongue to hold back the tears I told him I  didn’t mind that much, when suddenly, Clyde let out a yelp. My dog lived and we  laughed until we both were crying again.   That’s the way things were with Jesse; no matter what, he loved to  laugh.  <br /> </p>
<p>Jesse married the love of his life on September  18, 2004. They had a small but very intimate ceremony, Jesse again cried while  reading his vows. He swore it was the best day of his life and his advice was,  “Find someone you love with all your heart and don’t let him go.” <br /> </p>
<p>To watch Jesse with his wife was to  watch him live the childhood he was cheated out of. He loved her with the  innocence and pure conviction of a child.<br /> </p>
<p>On February 21, 2005, Jesse taught me his  final lesson: always put others first.   Honor, duty and strength these are some of the Army’s guiding  principles. Before the Humvee Jesse was riding in flipped, he pulled the gunner  to safety. After the soldiers had secured the bridge just outside of Baghdad,  he and three other soldiers carried a man on a gurney to a Med Vac helicopter.  A man watching from a tiny house just a mile away killed my brother and two  other Minnesota soldiers with one push of a button. He set off a bomb that sent  soldiers and shrapnel flying in all directions. <br /> </p>
<p>They say that Jesse died instantly and  I try to believe that because I know his thoughts wouldn’t have been of his own  pain, but the hurt he was leaving us all with.  <br /> </p>
<p>Jesse’s funeral was overflowing with over  1,000 mourners. People were asked to stand up and tell stories and I learned  even more about the man I thought I knew better than anyone else. <br /> I learned how his college buddies took  a bag of clothing meant for Goodwill, and Jesse drove all over St.Cloud trying  to return it, lest someone go without. I learned how he stayed up all night  listening to a battered wife, giving her the confidence to end her abusive  relationship. <br /> </p>
<p>There were stories of how he hung up  the sock off his foot on the fireplace at a friend’s house, hoping Santa would  come, and his of sharp temper at never winning bingo! Jesse touched so many  people with his love, his humor and his undying respect for life.  I wonder still how he ever had time for  himself while trying to save the world.<br /> </p>
<p>This year when I turned twenty-five, I  forced myself down that journey of self-examination. I had lived 20 days longer  than Jesse was ever allowed, a damning fault in its own. I began with the  matches and the memories tumbled back. Through every twist, every turn, every  regret and every victory there was Jesse guiding me, holding my hand, teaching  me and making me a better person. <br /> </p>
<p>Everyday I miss the man who taught me  so much about life. Jesse instilled in me a savage sense of loyalty and an  undying respect for life. He taught me to love, to be kind and to put others  before myself. Jesse will always be my hero.  </p>
