<p>On Nov. 12 I was ushered  into a reserved seat for the Friday night performance of <em>Ten by Tennessee</em>. After settling into my chair, I noticed immediately that the set was  made to exude a southern tropical elegance filled with lusciously green plants. <br /> </p>
<p>Fifties-style end tables, an old radio in  the background, a portable tray set up with liquor and low ball glasses waited  expectantly as if, at any moment, someone would fill them to the brink. <br /> In the background candles flickered and lace  drapes lined wide open doors while music filled the air. In the center of the  stage sat a classic high-backed wicker chair when suddenly, darkness and faint  whispering filled the room and at last, we were greeted formally by Mr.  Tennessee Williams himself, played by David Talarico.<br /> </p>
<p>The play opened with Tennessee directly  addressing the audience and whispering voices that faded into the background.  Our protagonist queued up and informed us of the presence of spirits, “souls,  real but not real,” inside the shadows of his one-time home in beloved New  Orleans. He told of the spirits that haunt him and won’t let go. And so they  did. <br /> </p>
<p>Tennessee told how mornings were his  favorite time of day, a time of creation and new beginnings which seemed to be  frequently interrupted by noisy and nosy neighbors or “memories as old  photographs.” Williams always felt pursued by something: his mother, his dear  lobotomized sister or the many characters he created. <br /> </p>
<p>Each character that graced the stage was a  part of who Tennessee Williams was, and they played to his melancholy, his  drink and his folly as any character is prone to do. Every cast member brought  life to Williams’ words and the intensity with which they grasped and held the  audience was complete.<br /> </p>
<p>For example, Amanda Weecks, who played  Willie in a scene from <em>This Property is  Condemned,</em> did an amazing job  portraying a young orphan telling the story of her dead sister Alva to Tom  (Dustin Suggs), a boy she meets in the middle of the day. <br /> </p>
<p>At one point, as Willie describes her life,  she tells the audience that she expects a fate not unlike her sister’s. The  room was so silent, you could have heard a pin drop as the audience watched  with baited breath the full range of sadness and understanding that befalls  Willie’s acceptance of her life. She knows she will die one day, much like her  sister and, in fact, almost seems to anticipate it gladly.<br /> </p>
<p>Debbie Iverson, Tracy Champion and Dustin  Suggs did a tremendous job portraying Amanda, Laura and Tom Wingfield in a  scene from <em>The Glass Menagerie, </em>a brilliant and tragic tale of a young man  (Tennessee himself) who knows he needs to leave his oppressive and depressed  life but is forever haunted by the guilt of leaving his disabled sister. <br /> </p>
<p>Upset that her daughter Laura has stopped  going to class to learn a skill, Amanda Wingfield becomes obsessed with finding  a husband for her. Tom, Amanda’s son, invites Jim (Ehren Babb) for a visit, but  he is engaged to be married, a fact Tom was not aware of. Amanda becomes  furious with Tom and, despite his love for his sister, he leaves, never to  return again.<br /> </p>
<p>Chelsea K. Vance did a fantastic job  revealing the depth of Blanche du Bois in a scene from <em>A Streetcar Named Desire</em>. As she talks with her sister, Stella (Amanda Weecks), she is overcome  with dramatic vacillation between apathy and emotional distress. <br /> </p>
<p>John McNeil did a splendid job as Big Daddy  in a scene with Maggie (Sadi Boren), his daughter-in-law from <em>Cat on a Hot Tin Roof</em>, and Forrest Nelson was great as Ralph Bates in <em>Period of Adjustment</em>.<br /> </p>
<p>All of the characters had so much to say yet  their actions and words implied so much more about Tennessee Williams, who  addressed the audience as I believe he did in his dramatic works: directly, but  not without implied loneliness and sadness. <br /> </p>
<p>David Talarico, as Tennessee Williams, told  the audience that the spirits of his life, the ones that whispered to him the  most, continued to hover between light and shadow.<br /> </p>
<p>Prone to drink, Tennessee Williams pursued  the end of each bottle as a means to escape, but his characters kept hold of  him, chasing him forward, propelling him to write. I have the very distinct  impression that Tennessee Williams tapped into the very darkest and deepest  demons of his own psyche when he created the characters that became the  catalyst of his livelihood.<br /> </p>
<p>As a person who has had virtually no  experience with the works of Tennessee Williams, I thought the production of <em>Ten by Tennessee</em> was eloquent and profound. Throughout the play there was an  overabundance of reality and angst coming from Tennessee and the other  characters who brought the conflict and drama to the stage. </p>
