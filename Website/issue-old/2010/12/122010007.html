<p>Graduation  is on the horizon for many anticipatory seniors this week. With all the  excitement, it is still important to remember that there is always more to  learn. Experiences can be found everywhere with the right set of skills. With  the help of the career services department here at Metropolitan State  University, here is a comprehensive set of job search tips for new  graduates—and future grads as well: <br /> </p>
<p>• Develop a strategy. Set goals and take  advantage of your time. Over 70 percent of jobs are found through networking.  Connect with others—it will pay off.</p>
<p>• Create a LinkedIn account via  www.linkedin.com. It’s a great way to stay in touch with Career Services. Their  tools are available at the following URLs: <em><a href="http://careerservices.linkedin.com/Build-A-Professional-Profile.pdf">http://careerservices.linkedin.com/Build-A-Professional-Profile.pdf</a>;  <a href="http://careerservices.linkedin.com/Network-Professionally.pdf; http://careerservices.linkedin.com/Conduct-Essential-Employer-Research.pdf">http://careerservices.linkedin.com/Network-Professionally.pdf;  http://careerservices.linkedin.com/Conduct-Essential-Employer-Research.pdf</a>.</em></p>
<p>•  Join a professional group or association. It’s a great way to network and find  out more information on the career field that interests you.</p>
<p>• Join a networking club or job search  group. Some can be found at <em><a href="http://www.positivelyminnesota.com/JobSeekers/WorkForce_Centers/Hennepin_South/PDFs/Metro_Area_Job_Support_Employment_Networking_Groups.pdf">http://www.positivelyminnesota.com/JobSeekers/WorkForce_Centers/Hennepin_South/PDFs/Metro_Area_Job_Support_Employment_Networking_Groups.pdf</a>.</em></p>
<p>• Develop a list of 30 places where you’d  like to work. To read more and learn how to compile such a list, see the career  workbook at <em>www.metrostate.edu/career.</em></p>
<p>• Compile a networking list. Don’t stop until  you reach 100 people—job leads pop up everywhere.</p>
<p>• Set your goal date—by when will you have a  job? Write it on a Post-It note and put it in a visible place, like on a  bathroom mirror. <br /> According to the career services  department, job searches typically take the length of time you give them, so  start today. <br /> • Take the time to participate in some of the  valuable workshops offered by career services such as the resume writing  workshop on Wednesday, Dec. 8 from 4-5:30 p.m. in Library 312 on the St. Paul  campus. To RSVP, visit: <em><a href="http://www.metrostate.edu/career">www.metrostate.edu/career</a>.</em></p>
<p>• Create a team. Have fellow students or  friends who are looking for jobs? Form a group to be accountable to. It’s  helpful to have peers to problem-solve and check in with and, of course, to  celebrate with you when you finally land a job!</p>
<p>Besides providing all of these helpful tips,  career services encourages new graduates and other alumni to remember that even  after your classes are completed here at Metropolitan State, the career  services office will continue to be available to them.</p>
<p>So, if you’re getting ready to take  that next step, take the time to perfect your resume on December 8 with the  workshop and access their helpful list of tips on the career services Web site. </p>
