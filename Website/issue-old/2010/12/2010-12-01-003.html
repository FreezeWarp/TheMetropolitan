<p>Exams, already? <strong>OMG! </strong><br /> </p>
<p>Are you like most  Metropolitan State University students with family obligations, school  commitments and work responsibilities? How do you stop long enough to even  start studying? “It’s not stress that kills us. It is our reaction to it,” said  Dr. Hans Selye in <em>The Stress of Life</em> (1956). <br /> </p>
<p>You’re tense but you  can ease your reaction to stress through meditation. There are some simple  techniques that you can easily do anywhere to relieve exam and everyday stress.<br /> Once you have tried  the following techniques, you will find that meditation quiets your mind and  calms your body. It also helps you to settle down to concentrate.  Non-denominational techniques are intended to be helpful and start you down the  road to disocvering what works for you. I was once a hyperactive, stressed,  helter-skelter, frantic student who found a practice that transformed me into a  composed, peaceful person. I have been practicing for more than 20 years and,  with the help of these simple meditation techniques, I maintain good health and  a focused positive perspective. <br /> </p>
<p>When I started  meditating, my only quiet place was in the bathroom. Whatever works—right?  Whatever it may be called: meditation, reflection or contemplation, the result  is less stress.    <br /> Most meditation  starts with how you breathe. To begin, take a deep breath.<br /> </p>
<p>Breathe deeply in and out three times, slowly and  deliberately. Are you comfortable with taking a few moments to deliberately  breathe deeply? Did it slow you down? How’s your focus right now? This is one  of the simple techniques that can help you to become quiet and centered. <br /> </p>
<p>You might also find  a place where you can try out one of these simple meditation techniques:    <strong> </strong><br /> </p>
<p>• Centering  meditation cultivates the personal relationship with the self through regular  practice and is described as simply as it is performed.<br /> • Choose a special  word, like solace (but not a person because they might run around in your  thoughts.)<br /> • Breathe deeply.  Sit comfortably with your eyes closed and back straight.<br /> • Settle in and  silently say the word.<br /> </p>
<p>When other thoughts enter, gently return to the word.<br /> • Remember the three  r’s: receive nothing, reject nothing, return to the word. You will sense when  it’s time to open your eyes, then breathe deeply three times.<br /> </p>
<p>Lectio Divina is  known as sacred reading and has been practiced by both laypersons and monastics  since the early Christian centuries. It is presented with Latin terms, which  are almost always used. <br />  </p>
<p>• <em>Lectio</em>:  Silently read a brief passage from any inspirational writing and listen.<br /> • <em>Meditatio</em>:  Meditate on the passage and reflect.<br /> • <em>Oratio</em>:  Read the passage aloud and integrate it into your being.<br /> • <em>Contemplatio</em>:  Listen with the ear of your heart and receive. Breathe slowly, deliberately.<br />  </p>
<p>The practice of  Zazen and Christian contemplative practice are much alike:<br /> </p>
<p>• Sit comfortably. <br /> • Count your breath  to the count of ten. Slowly and deliberately, inhale on one, exhale on two, all  the way to ten. Start over when your mind wanders or you reach ten. <strong>Or</strong> try chanting an inspirational word softly, quietly, repeatedly and  thoughtfully. <strong>Or</strong> visualize a serene setting and simply “be.”</p>
