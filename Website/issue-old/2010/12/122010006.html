<p>Gift buying is on the rise  as the holidays are nearing us. Popular gifts for the holidays this year  include video game consoles or games, DVDs, digital cameras, iPods and the  Kindle. These are fun gifts but you can also have endless fun and put your money  to a good cause by adopting a cat from the Animal Humane Society (AHS) or  asking someone to adopt a pet for you. <br /> </p>
<p>In 2009 alone, the AHS took in 35,989  animals, 20,646 of which were cats. Because of this huge increase of cats at  their five locations throughout Minnesota, the AHS came up with an ongoing  promotion called Double the Love and lowered the adoption fee of cats over the  age of one year to $50.<br /> </p>
<p>Double the Love was started last year for a  four-month-long introductory program where 700 cats were adopted and given new  homes. The program was so successful that it was brought back in March. This  year alone, 1,066 cats have been adopted through the program. <br /> </p>
<p>Carrie Libera, public relations associate at  the AHS, explained that even though the promotion has been very successful, the  number of cats coming into their shelters is still much higher than the number  of cats people are willing to adopt. <br /> </p>
<p>“In order to further increase adoptions, we  restarted the promotion this year to reduce the adoption fee for all adult cats  to $50,” Libera said. “This is a huge savings from the regular price of  $89-$145.” <br /> </p>
<p>In other words, customers can adopt one cat  of any age at the regular adoption fee and the fee will be waived for the  second cat of one year of age or older. “By continuing this program  indefinitely, the AHS hopes to greatly increase the number of cats going to  their forever homes,” Libera said. <br /> </p>
<p>Included in the $50 adoption fee:<br /> </p>
<p>• A general physical  examination and behavioral evaluation by the veterinary services staff at the  AHS<br /> • Vaccinations<br /> • Worming medication<br /> • Flea and tick treatment<br /> • Spay or neuter surgery<br /> • Microchip implant, to  provide permanent identification, which is registered at the time of adoption <br /> •Free follow-up examination  by a participating veterinarian<br /> • 30-day trial period to  make sure things work out at home<br /> • Free medications for the  first 14 days (if needed)<br /> • One coupon that is good  for a free bag of Purina One pet food<br /> </p>
<p>Libera also encourages the public to have  their cats sterilized to prevent future litters of unwanted kittens. “According  to Spay USA, 10,000 children are born per day in the U.S., compared to 42,000  kittens born per day,” she said. “If more cats are sterilized before they are  able to reproduce, we will see a dramatic reduction of felines living as strays  and in shelters.” <br />  </p>
<p>Libera also said that it is very important  that the new cat is microchipped to increase the chances of being reunited with  its family if it gets lost. “It will ultimately decrease the number of stray  cats that end up in shelters,” she said. <br />  </p>
<p>The AHS has five locations in Minnesota: St.  Paul (not far from Metropolitan State University’s Midway Campus), Coon Rapids,  Golden Valley, Buffalo and Woodbury. More information on hours and locations  can be found online at <em><a href="http://www.animalhumanesociety.org">www.animalhumanesociety.org</a>.</em> <br /> </p>
<p>Whether you are asking for an adopted cat  this holiday season or you’re giving an adopted pet to someone as a gift, both  decisions require a lot of thought beforehand. Giving an pet as a gift is a  wonderful thing to do for the holidays, but the person who will be caring for  the pet should also be a part of the decision to make a commitment so that the  animal won’t end up back at a shelter.  <br /> </p>
<p>The holidays are around the corner, and what  better way to spend the chilly season than to bring home one or two new furry  friends to curl up on the couch with and watch the snow fall? Not only will the  new pets be so thankful they were given a new home, but your heart will be  warmed even when it’s freezing outside. Have a wonderful holiday season and  happy adopting!</p>
