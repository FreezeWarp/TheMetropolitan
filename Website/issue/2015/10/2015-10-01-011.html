<p>Let’s explain the title first. In no way am I a nut. Maybe, I’m just passionate about certain things in life. I take certain hobbies to extremes, and my hobbies include politics, cooking, movies, concerts, writing and oh— guns. I love guns. Big guns, fast guns, small guns, and especially antique guns. When it comes to the politics of guns in America, things have become controversial. I want to disprove the theory that being liberal means you’re anti-gun.</p>

<p>There is nothing quite like shooting or owning a gun. The idea of owning a gun and being a responsible gun owner is controversial now. Even that sentence above is considered crazy to most liberals in the media. I know many liberals that are responsible gun owners. What do I mean when I say responsible?</p>

<p>Shooting guns, first off, is terrifying, especially your first time. Then it becomes exhilarating. It’s fun. It’s therapeutic. Shooting can be a sport just like football or baseball.  But, the biggest thing that comes with it is responsibility. Ultimately a gun is a tool for a purpose.</p>

<p>The responsibility of a owning a gun lies in the fact that it can kill. It can kill anything and anyone. Certain individuals lose their physical advantage when facing someone with a gun. A woman can take down any number of men who have terrible intentions. An unathletic man can become the deadliest person in the room. That is what a gun does for people. It is a tool for defending yourself in a variety of ways.</p>

<p>As someone who just experienced a situation where a criminal had a handgun on him, I was glad to have had a gun to defend my home. Except in that case, what I choose to do was call the police instead of going outside to confront the individual with my own gun, potentially causing a disaster that could have ended my life or that of an innocent bystander. As a responsible gun owner you should do everything to prevent using your weapon. Rely on the civil services for the issues that may involve a weapon of any nature.</p>

<p>The point I am trying to make is that as a liberal, I like guns. I see the point to them as home defense tools and also of using them to participate in the sport of shooting. It might seem strange that I take this stance, as I am a liberal who believes in single-payer healthcare, interest-free school loans and taxing corporations. I support pro-choice politics and have been pro-gay marriage since I was a kid. It really makes the conversation awkward with my considerably liberal friends. Many ask, “Why do I need a gun?” “Because,” I answer, “It’s my right.” Ultimately, what it boils down to isn’t a black and white situation. If anything, life isn’t defined by lines; it’s murky and morality is grey.</p>
