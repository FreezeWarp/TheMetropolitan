<p>Metropolitan State University is working to update its website to serve current students. Last March, a new version of Metro’s website was launched. The majority of its content was created for prospective students. According to Steven Adrian, Metro’s Web Presence Director, Metro’s IT department has been working with The Nerdery and Ingeniux Professional Services to build a new framework for current students. This framework is expected to launch by the end of September.</p>
<p>The site’s top navigation bar will change when the framework is launched. “How the site is set up, it says ‘new site/old site’ on the top of the navigation,” said Adrian. “What’ll happen is, those words will be changed to ‘prospective students’ and then the old site will be changed to ‘current students.’”</p>
<p>Student-related content will be migrated from the old site to the “current students” tab sometime between the new framework launch and the end of the year. Student resources and tools will be migrated first.</p>
<p>Prior to the first phase launched in March, it had been six or seven years since the website had been updated. However, Metro will be taking a new approach to updating the website in the future. “Starting in the first part of October, we’re actually going to be training staff, which could range from departmental level, administrative support … and our faculty members, or other people who will be updating different sections of the site … on how to use [the content management system] Ingeniux,” said Adrian. That is, faculty and staff outside of IT will be updating the site along with the IT department.</p>
<p>Adrian said there are no budgetary concerns for the website project at this time. Previously, the website project was working on a special project budget, which is a one-time allocation. However, that has changed. This year, web presence was added in the budget as a line item. “What that means is in the future we’ll actually be budgeting for different web initiatives or web technologies that we’ll look to add to the university, where as in the past there was no budget line for the website,” Adrian said. “Now we’re trying to budget each year for the web.”</p>
