<p>Minnesota State Colleges and Universities (MnSCU) is beginning its search to find a permanent president for Metropolitan State University. According to a letter from Steven Rosenstone, Chancellor of MnSCU, a committee will begin a national search for Interim President Devinder Malhotra’s successor this October. Rosenstone will visit Metro’s campus on Oct. 22 for a listening session. A new president is expected to be appointed by July 1, 2016.</p>
<p>In a letter to the university community, Rosenstone expressed his appreciation for Malhotra’s efforts. “As interim president he has worked with students, faculty, staff, and the community to keep the university moving carefully but steadily forward … He designed and is implementing a new organizational structure to improve the quality and transparency of decision-making, genuine consultation, and open communication.” Rosenstone continued, “The reorganization, and the improvements he has made to the administrative support systems, will continue to strengthen the university, help restore trust, and support faculty delivering an exceptional education to students.”</p>
<p>A search advisory committee will be appointed to begin looking for a viable candidate. Scott Olson, president of Winona State University, will chair the committee. Likewise, Deb Gehrke, MnSCU’s chief human resources officer, will be involved with the committee in a support role. Other appointments will include students, faculty, staff and community leaders.</p>
