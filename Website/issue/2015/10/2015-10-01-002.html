<p>It’s no secret that Metropolitan State has been undergoing some major construction projects in the last two years. Most educationally driven: the science building. Most talked about: the parking ramp. However, something very student life driven is arriving on campus, and it is bringing a lot of excitement to the college.</p>
<p>The new Student Center is located on the main campus and it has students, faculty and staff incredibly excited. When it opens, the space itself will be an environment where students can hang out, meet and get homework done.</p>
<p>“For the student who is not involved in any extracurricular activities, the Student Center should still be [a] draw,” said Philip Fuehrer, the Assistant Student Life Director at Metro. Functionally, on-campus food services with a lounge area will be available as well as study areas and a fitness center — which will be free to students.</p>
<p>There will be spaces available for extracurricular activities and groups. Currently, the campus organizations with plans to move into the building are Student Senate, Student Life and Leadership Development, and The Metropolitan. Amber Hamm, President of the Student Senate, says that she is “pushing to have some more organizations move [into the new student life building].” Hamm is excited for the Senate’s move, as the meeting space “will be in a glass wall facing the hall so anyone can see the meetings through it.”</p>
<p>The excitement surrounding the space is simple to explain. With this student center, the school has an opportunity to begin achieving something it has always struggled to find: a heartbeat. This building will provide a central location for any student, actively involved or not, to have a central meeting place. Right now, Metro has four primary campuses, only two of which fully belong to the School. This has been the source of identity issues for the student population. A student center could be the beginning of a solidified identity, a creation of a core idea for student-driven spaces.</p>
<p>All of the planned features of the new building won’t be ready right away. The cafeteria and the fitness center will not be fully equipped until January. Thus, there will be two openings: a soft opening in mid-October for the facilities themselves, and an official grand opening on January 19, signifying the facility’s completion.</p>
<p>“I’m most excited about the prospect of creating an atmosphere that makes the center the living room of the university,” said Fuehrer. “I think there will be an energy and activity that we just have not seen at Metro State in the past.</p>
