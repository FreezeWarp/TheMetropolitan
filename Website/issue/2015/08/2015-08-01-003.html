<p>The state of Minnesota loves its baseball. That is easily assured considering Minneapolis is often ranked as one of professional baseball’s premier cities. When the Twins go to the playoffs, people of all ages bring browned, wrinkled 1987, 1991, and beyond “homer hankies” to support their boys in red and white stripes. But, after over twenty years, the Twins aren’t the only local focus of baseball this season.</p>
<p>The Saint Paul Saints are stealing the spotlight from their Major League neighbors. An inaugural season for a brand new stadium, the best- winning percentage in their entire league, and record breaking attendance, “Fun is Good” may be the St. Paul Saints slogan “…but so is winning” should be slapped at the end for good measure.</p>
<p>With a nearly 80 percent winning rate as of the 4th of July, the Saints are riding high as the number one team in the American Association. But, that’s only a recent achievement. The buzz surrounding the team largely comes from a new stadium, “CHS Field,” in the crest of Lowertown, with downtown on one side and Metropolitan State University on the other—a ten- minute walk from the main campus. “</p>
<p>CHS Field” boasts itself as a largely green effort, with necessary actions taking place in order for a new stadium to fit within the workings of a city that has made recycling and green actions as some of its most prominent.</p>
<p>Pair that with its partnerships with Metro State and Hamline University, and it remains to serve as an example of a modern sports stadium meshing with an urban environment. It’s modernity is only overshadowed by its traditional core: there is still a nun who gives free back massages, two pigs—one fit for a barn and the other for “Sesame Street”—matched with fun and affordability above all else, —with tickets running anywhere from five to twenty dollars a ticket.</p>
<p>It’s with this relentless focus on making sure things stay the same the more they change. There’s something truly romantic about the St. Paul Saints new “CHS Field.” Being situated in the crest of Lowertown, I I can’t help but imagine a Brooklyn Dodgers game circa the 1940’s. With an intimate crowd of less than 10,000, a baseball team playing purely for the love of the sport, and an illuminated downtown St. Paul in the background, the team brings baseball back to a city that wholly deserves it.</p>
