<p>The Muslim Student Organization (MSO) was an active and funded student club from 2007 to 2015. Student participation was dwindling, and eventually the organization was cut. I would like to revive the club. There is a large and growing Muslim population on campus, and it would be nice for Muslims to have a place of meeting and socialization.</p>
<p>Student organizations at Metropolitan State University need to have four officers to receive funding. That means that in order for MSO to get to the next step we need a President, Vice President, Secretary and Treasurer.</p>
<p>Besides those positions, I propose that MSO should establish additional posts to ensure its success in the future. Potential titles include Web Designer, On-Campus Recruiter, Spokesperson and Event Organizer.</p>
<p>After that is settled, MSO will be able approach the Student Life and Leadership Development and Student Activity Fees Allocation Committees for an allotment of student activity fees. Then, the rest of the process will be easy.</p>
<p>According to Gianni Quilici, a staff member in the Undergraduate Office of Admissions, the new student center will have a prayer room, which will be able to accommodate several students at one time. This would be all the more reason for MSO to reorganize and provide Muslim students with a sense of community.</p>
<p>If youâ€™re a Muslim student interested in connecting with fellow students and having a voice, please email me at cj1190fc@metrostate.edu and we can begin to take action.</p>
