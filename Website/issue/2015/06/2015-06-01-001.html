<p>Another semester is quickly approaching Metropolitan State University, and with every new semester comes a fresh wave of students from all different backgrounds, situations and lifestyles, including veterans and military students who work hard to serve our community and our country. Registration and picking out new classes for the fall semester can be very exciting, but it can also be difficult to discover all the resources Metro has. One powerful resource for students to be aware of is Metro’s Veterans and Military Student Services (also known as VMSS), which is located in the Veterans and Military Student Center at the Saint Paul Campus on the second floor of Founders Hall.</p>

<p>Veterans, military students and their families can find free on-campus support through VMSS. “Our primary purpose,” said Mike Anderson, senior student worker for the VMSS, “is to assist veteran students with applying for, understanding and utilizing their educational benefits which they earned while in the military.”</p>

<p>The Veterans Center also provides student veterans and military students with a safe environment to access computers and talk to knowledgeable staff. “Any student veteran can come into our office to simply decompress, relax, study, do homework, fill out veterans paperwork, or simply ‘shoot the breeze’ with a fellow veteran,” said Anderson.</p>

<p>Metro is no stranger to supporting veterans and military students. The university has long been hailed a military-friendly school and was listed on the Military Advanced Education’s “2014 Top Military-Friendly Colleges and Universities” database. In 2013, Metro was named a Yellow Ribbon Company in recognition of its work to support veterans, service members and family members. The VMSS and Veterans Center work continuously to uphold these recognitions and support current and future service members, both active and retired.</p>

<p>Metro’s VMSS strives to make the transition into higher education easy and painless. “The transformation from service member to student can present many challenges,” said Anderson. “Whether you need serious, life-affecting questions answered or simply want to pull up a chair and have a cup of coffee we are always here for you.”  Staff can guide students through available resources, including educational benefits for spouses and children, applicable scholarships, financial assistance, counseling services, disability services and access to academic advisors.</p>

<p>Recently, the Veterans Center also put effort into broadcasting awareness about the Minnesota GI Bill to veterans and military students. “This is a modest but helpful financial benefit that many student veterans do not know about,” said Anderson.</p>

<p>For veterans and military students who are new to Metro, there’s more to discover than simply resources. The VMSS holds several events a year for their students. Paintball games, summer picnics, professional development programs for active military personnel, award ceremonies and art exhibitions are only a few of the events students are invited to attend and enjoy. Interested students are encouraged to contact the Veterans Center for details about upcoming events.</p>

<p>To learn more about the services Metro offers for veterans and military students, stop by the Veterans Center—fresh coffee and welcoming faces are always available. Office hours are Monday–Thursday, 9:30 a.m.–6 p.m. and Friday, 9:30 a.m.–4 p.m.</p>
