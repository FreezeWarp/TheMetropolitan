<p>Metropolitan State University has approved a new master’s program in urban education and the first class offerings rolled out for the summer semester.  According to a recent press release, the program will focus on providing educators with the knowledge and skills they need to make a difference in the lives of urban youth, families and communities. Applications for the fall semester are currently being accepted.</p>
<p>Rose Chu is the Interim Dean of the School of Urban Education. “We have had a graduate certificate for secondary education teacher preparation for a few years,” she said. “The goal has always to augment the graduate certificate into a master’s degree.”  In fact, besides secondary education, the new master’s degree has four other program concentrations available including special education and English as a Second Language.</p>
<p>With this new program, Metro State has positioned itself uniquely among local universities. “As far as we can tell, we are the only institution that is offering a Master of Science in Urban Education in Minnesota at this point,” said Chu.  “We are also the only academic unit in Minnesota that calls out urban education among all other educator and teacher preparation programs.”</p>
<p>Chu said this new program is a perfect fit for our university because of the urban location and diverse student body. “We are the most diverse in terms of faculty and staff demographics for an education unit in Minnesota; 2/3 of all faculty and staff in the School of Urban Education are persons of color. We are also the most diverse in terms of our student body; we currently enroll over 40% students of color.” “Collectively as faculty, staff and students, we have incredible rich knowledge, along with personal and professional experiences in urban education that inform our work,” said Chu. “Besides the affordability of Metro State, our new master’s program is a tremendous opportunity for many professionals to explore ‘moving the needle’ on the academic achievement of our underserved urban E-12 learners.”</p>
