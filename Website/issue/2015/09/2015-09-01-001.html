<p>It’s September, which means a new semester at Metropolitan State University has been underway for a few weeks already. In a way, this is a relief. All the right books have been purchased, all the class syllabi have been reviewed, and all the first homework assignments have (hopefully) been completed. As things start to settle into a routine, however, students might find they have more time during the school day then they expected. They might start to wonder, “What does Metro have to offer me besides simply the credits I’m taking?” The answer to that question might just be one of Metro’s many wonderful and unique student organizations!</p>

<p>According to OrgSync, Metro’s “Campus Engagement Network for Student Involvement,” Metro has 49 registered student organizations that students of all ages, races, cultures and interests can get involved with. Metro students are welcome to create an account using their Metro email to access these organizations. Some student organizations are “invite only,” while others are always available to join, but students should feel free to reach out to any student organization they’re interested in joining, “invite only” or not.</p>

<p>There are many student organizations available at Metro, ranging anywhere from the Accounting Club to Lavender Bridge (for LGBTQA students and allies) to the Alcohol and Drug Counseling Student Association. Students who are new to Metro, as well as returning students who perhaps haven’t yet found the time to get involved, should consider joining a student organization (or two) during their college career.</p>


<h2>Get involved in your school community</h2>

<p>Joining a student organization is a great way to get active in Metro’s community and become immersed in its culture. Student organizations often hold many activities year-round, including informative meetings on various topics, resources about workshops and festivals, and engaging community events (all depending on which student organization you want to join). Metro’s Annual Leadership Retreat, hosted by Student Life and Leadership Development, and FallFest, hosted by the University Activities Board, are only two examples of the variety of activities provided by student organizations for students.</p>


<h2>Meet new people and make new connections</h2>

<p>Students can also use Metro’s various student organizations to learn more about what’s happening on and around campus. Is there an issue Metro students are currently facing? You’ll learn what it is. Are Metro students coming together to fight for a specific cause (such as Project SAVE, a Sexual Assault Prevention initiative)? If you talk to someone from a student organization, they can probably fill you in on the details specific to their organization.</p>

<p>Networking like this is a great asset, and one of the reasons why joining a student organization is a smart move. Students who are a part of a student organization have the opportunity to meet and converse with a lot of fascinating people, including Metro professors and students who come from all sorts of different backgrounds and interests. Meeting new people around campus can help students get involved at Metro beyond sitting in class and meeting up with classmates for a group assignment. Not only might you expand your worldview, but you’ll also build solid, professional connections that will last far beyond graduation.</p>

<h2>Gain life experience that you can put on your resume</h2>

<p>Several organizations at Metro give students the opportunity to grow into leadership or volunteer roles. At The Metropolitan, for example, you can work as a student writer, or you can work as an editor, which builds relevant experience that you can apply to a career after graduation. Other organizations, like the Student Senate, let students apply for roles that allow them to speak out in Metro’s community and vote on important issues. And some organizations are always looking for volunteers to help set up and run events. No matter which opportunity you choose to go for, these experiences will help you build and add extracurricular activity to your resume and cover letters, showing potential employers that you were involved and active in your school’s community.</p>

<p>So if you find yourself with extra time this semester, consider checking out Orgsync.com for any student organizations that you might be interested in joining. There’s something out there for every type of student. You may just find yourself getting involved in your community, meeting new people and building life experience!</p>
