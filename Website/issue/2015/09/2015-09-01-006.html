<p>It’s the beginning of the semester and the first month back in class after an absolutely gorgeous summer. Chances are, you’re having a less-than-easy time getting back into the swing of things. Unfortunately for you, your homework won’t wait and, believe it or not, mid-terms are just around the corner. Don’t panic! The staff at the Metropolitan have got your back. We’re about to divulge our top five study tips to give you the back-to-school boost you need.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Review your class notes DAILY. This might seem like a lot of work, but when done effectively it only takes 30 minutes to review each day. And research has shown that reviewing material within 24 hours of learning it increases your retention significantly. Of course, detailed, concise notes make for the most helpful review.</li>
  <li>Pay attention to instructor cues. Your instructors will typically give hints as to what’s important to take down. Some of the more common cues include:</li>

  <ol>
    <li>Material written on the blackboard.</li>
    <li>Repeated information. </li>
    <li>Emphasis, which can be judged by tone of voice, gesture and the amount of time an instructor spends on certain points.</li>
    <li>Summaries given at the end of class.</li>
    <li>Reviews given at the beginning of class.</li>
   </ol></li>

  <li>Make your notes brief. Never use a sentence where you can use a phrase. Never use a phrase where you can use a word. Use outline form and/or a numbering system. Indention helps you distinguish major from minor points. Use abbreviations but be consistent. Put most notes in your own words. However, formulas, definitions and specific facts should be noted exactly.</li>
  <li>Take full advantage of your textbook. While some professors may give detailed, page-by-page assignments, many do not. Take the initiative. At a minimum, skim the relevant chapters before a lecture. How can you properly skim a chapter, you ask? 
  <ol>
    <li>Scan the chapter quickly, taking note of the chapter objectives (normally found at the beginning   of the chapter), headings, subheadings and illustrations. Also, be sure to read any vocabulary terms you find.</li>
    <li>When you’ve finished your initial scan, go back to the beginning and read in more detail. This        time around, concentrate on understanding the core concepts. If you own the book and intend to keep it, you may want to take notes in the margins to help you remember the concepts and, by all means, take similar notes in your notebook. </li>
  </ol></li>
  <li>GET AT LEAST SEVEN HOURS OF SLEEP EVERY DAY! We’ve heard all the excuses, “ Oh, I only need 3 hours a night,” or “Sleeping more than 5 hours a night just makes me groggy all day.” Save it! We don’t want to hear it. Just ask any Metro psychology professor and they’ll tell you that you need your sleep to be the best student you can be. Granted, every now and then, we all find ourselves in a jam that requires the dreaded “all-nighter,” but you’re doing yourself a major disservice when you don’t regularly make time to get enough of sleep. You may think you’re operating optimally, but you aren’t. So do yourself a favor, and get the sleep you need. </li>
</ol>

<p>Well, there you have it. Our top 5 study tips for Fall 2015. Just follow these suggestions and we guarantee your “A” at the end of the semester … Just kidding. We can’t actually guarantee that, but we hope these tips help and wish you a very successful semester.</p>
