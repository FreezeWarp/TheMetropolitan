<p><strong>Editor’s Note: In late March 2016, a handful of The Metropolitan staff flew to Los Angeles for the annual Association of Writers and Writing Programs (AWP). Last year, Editor Kevin Miller went to AWP when it was hosted in Minneapolis.</strong></p>

<p>It would be a lie to say that a single writing conference can suddenly, swiftly with the flick of the switch, make Los Angeles come alive. But to say AWP was simply a blip on the southern metropolitan city can’t be true either. With tens of thousands of writers coming into downtown, thousands of organizations represented, writing became manifested in human form.</p>
<p>The workshops are wonderfully more than expected. These aren’t the standard laissez-faire, run of the mill workshops readily expected from a seminar. Usually, the workshops focused on various underrepresented populations becoming empowered through writing; this is with the ultimate hope of making writing more inclusive. But, topics ranging from publishing to various forms of narratives to properly representing perspectives other than one’s own were proudly put on display. Additionally, an emphasis on networking for a largely introverted industry was pushed on a large scale. “Networking for Introverts” was featured on day one.</p>
<p>Bridging the gap between typing keys and creating legitimate relationship to ensure industry success was one of the overarching themes of the entire weekend. “Thinking like an Editor” brought this idea to true light, with emphasis on writer’s networking as well as prolonged success concerning the established relationships. With the size and scope of conference, the opportunities offered lend to an enthusiastic amount of potential.</p>
<p>The largest aspect of the conference was quite easily the book fair. In this area, hundreds of publishers and vendors set up booths to sell their products. With these hopeful vendors putting their wares on display, it’s pretty easy to see the excitement. The Public Broadcast Station (PBS) was there on the last day of the conference, interviewing various authors throughout the day. Sure, this conference was by all means an educational event, but don’t cut it short by not looking at its business and cultural values, as well.</p>
<p>To give most credit to one workshop or speaker makes the conference’s mission statement somewhat moot. After all, when the PDF of the event list of AWP’s website led to a 62 page document. Given the scope of the conference, the only suitable answer of “was this conference worth it?” is almost criminally simple: Absolutely. An optimistic tinge rubbed off onto the newspaper staff was transferred from sunny California to not so sunny, but ever pleasant Minnesota. The tinge itself was not the only benefit, but each Metropolitan representative was busy going to workshops each day from dusk until dawn. It seems that more times than not, the excitement of ensuring the arrival of especially crucial workshops took over; it was never a chore. With new perspective under our belts and increased ambition in our hearts, AWP Los Angeles 2016 is a trip that none of us will soon forget.</p></article>
