<article><p>For some of us May 30th merely marks the beginning of a one week break from syllabi, homework, and classes. For the rest of us, it’s the beginning of a glorious three month recess of reorganized priorities and, if you’re lucky, some refreshing downtime. And while naps are by and large my favorite way to pass the time, I’d like to propose a few family friendly activities and events to help keep the cabin fever at bay.</p>

<p><strong>Eating healthy is no joking matter, but that doesn’t mean it can’t be fun.</strong></p>

<p>So dust off that old sun hat, slap on some sunscreen, and head to the Farmer’s market. The two big ones are in St. Paul and Minneapolis but I can only guarantee a good time at the Minneapolis/Lyndale Avenue Farmers Market since it’s the only one I’ve been to as of late. Each and every time I visit I get a sense of refreshing nostalgia that makes me resent today’s retail experiences more so than normal.</p>

<p>It also makes me feel good knowing that I’m supporting local small businesses. Not only can you have your pick of the ripest fruits and veggies at really affordable prices, but they have apparel tents, jewelry stands, henna body art, and delicious cooked foods that are typically understood as summer staples. The market is open everyday (mid-April to mid-November) from 6a.m. to 1p.m. but most visitors choose to go on the weekend since that when the largest number of vendors are around. This can be a really great way to enjoy the summer. Don’t overlook it. </p>

<p><strong>Friends that sweat together, stay together. </strong></p>

<p>That’s why getting together with friends and enjoying fitness activities that make me forget I’m getting a workout are BIG on my summer to do list. That’s why Brunswick Zone XL has become a regular meeting spot/fitness center for my comrades and I. </p>

<p>On Wednesdays and Sundays we pay just under $10 each to enjoy unlimited lazer tag and bowling. I know it sounds childish, the thought of adults running through a laser tag arena, but appearances aside, it’s a lot of fun and a really great workout to boot. You can find Brunswick Zone XL in Edina and Brooklyn Park, MN and if you’re not into laser tag or bowling, you’ll also find pool tables, a large arcade, and an adult lounge with delicious adult beverages. It took some convincing but once I got my gang out there once, there’s been no shortage of requests to return. </p>

<p><strong>I used to have a fear of boats, but that ship sailed. </strong></p>

<p>As the land of 10,000 lakes there’s absolutely no reason why your summer should be boatless. Do a web search of boat cruises offered in the twin cities and you’re sure to find one that’s right up your alley. They typically have fun themes, like Lake Minnetonka’s “BBQ Picnic Lunch Cruise” or the far less sophisticated “Booty Cruise” where lots of skin and lots of booze are the central theme. </p>

<p>Whatever your predilection, cruises and boats are a very refreshing way to spend your time. In fact, hydrotherapy has long been acclaimed for its physical, mental, and emotional benefits. </p>

<p><strong>Unleash the Indiana Jones within. </strong></p>

<p>Minnesota is one of a decreasing number of states that truly values wildlife. Sure, they’re no Yosemite, but Minnesota is home to 67 state parks, 7 state recreation areas, 8 state waysides, and 22 state trails. Go for a hike, do some archeological type digging, have yourself a swim or be really cool and hit up the Wabasha Street Caves in St. Paul. They’re really cool and have a history that’s even cooler. You can sign up for a professional tour or pack a lunch and some friends and hit the caves on an excursion of your own. Just keep in mind that caves can be dangerous and you should be extra careful to do some research about how to keep you and your group as safe as possible. </p>

<p><strong>A great remedy for a long day is a short walk.  </strong></p>
<p>Every month beginning in June Open Streets Minneapolis temporarily closes major streets throughout Minneapolis and opens them up for Minnesotans to walk, bike, skate, eat, and browse various vendors. It’s a great way to learn about initiatives happening across the city as many community organizations attend with the goal of passing on crucial information to community members. It really is a great way to take a load off and meet new people. The first Open Streets event, “Open Streets Lyndale” will take place on June 5th. Check out their website (openstreetsmpls.org) for more information on these great events and if you see me out there (because I always am), feel free to stop and say “What’s up?”</p></article>
