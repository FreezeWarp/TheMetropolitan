<p>Raising trout eggs over the course of a school year sounds like a narrow niche—and it is—but it also requires a keen exploration of watershed education and habitats.</p>
<p>In turn, watershed preservation really means being a good steward of the overall environment, said John Lenczewski, executive director of the Minnesota chapter of Trout Unlimited, which sponsored the Minnesota Youth Trout Summit on April 15.</p>
<p>About 400 elementary, middle school, and high school students from nine schools descended upon Metropolitan State’s Saint Paul Campus for the event. Throughout the day they attended seminars from environmental professionals, including the Raptor Center, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, the U.S. Forest Service, Wilderness Inquiry, local meteorologist Sam Ryan, and Metropolitan State professor Kate Edelman.</p>
<p>The interconnectedness of the environment was highlighted in a presentation by Jennifer Teegarden, DNR forestry outreach specialist. An interactive exercise prompted students from Rockford Middle School to identify some unlikely products that include wood (like some cheese!) and the nuanced impact of trees on everyday life. Trees protect the habitat for fish by providing buffer zones that absorb pollutants on shore and shade to cool the water. Lesser-known qualities include the fact that trees have been proven to reduce stress in humans.</p>
<p>The Rockford students experienced the ups and downs of raising trout. Some lessons were learn the hard way.</p>
<p>“We were losing 30 a day,” said Rockford eighth-grader Sarah Pflipsen.</p>
<p>“They’ve definitely done a lot of water quality analysis,” said Rockford agriculture teacher Clint Smith, noting specifics like pH balance and nitrate levels that affect trout eggs and hatchlings.</p>
<p>The highlight for Pflipsen and other students from Rockford, whose middle school is a STEM magnet, will be a field trip to Lake Vermilion to release the surviving trout.</p>
<p>In a broader sense, Trout Unlimited’s goal is fostering an appreciation for the outdoors. “Our concern is that, for many students, their only experience outdoors is the soccer field,” said executive director John Lenczewski.</p>
<p>The Trout Unlimited partnership is in the first of three years at the participating schools as a supplement. Some, like Rockford, already have a focus on environmental studies.</p>
<p>Mariah Flohr, an eleventh-grade student from the School of Environmental Studies in Apple Valley, had already been focusing on composting to keep nutrients out of landfills. The trout project added a new spin for her classmates. </p>
<p>Her class will only have about 50 trout to release this spring due to a moss growing on the eggs, which require a specific temperature, oxygen level, and current to thrive. The students could not mimic the current of a trout habitat in a tank. </p>
<p>“We expected to lose some, but not quite this much,” Flohr said.</p>
<p>Participating schools include Horace Mann (Saint Paul) and Salem Lutheran (Stillwater) elementaries, and Murray Middle School in Saint Paul, and Rockford Middle and High School. Also attending were high schoolers from Humboldt, Hopkins, Stillwater, Winona, and the School for Environmental Studies.</p>
<p>The event also gave Metropolitan State a chance to show off its facilities to potential students.</p>
<p>Flohr said her favorite part of the day was the pathology seminar to study bacteria and viruses. They cut open dead fish to see the eggs—and found a living parasite.</p>
<p>“That was really cool,” Flohr said.</p>
