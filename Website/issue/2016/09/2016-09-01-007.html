<p>Community resources come in all different ways. You can get your news by way of neighborhood paper, the Nextdoor app, or by tuning in to WEQY 104.7 FM—a low-power radio station. What the heck is a low-power station? A station that has a smaller broadcast radius. In August of last year, WEQY started testing their signals with their mission statement in mind:</p>
<p>“WEQY envisions a socially, economically and politically powerful East Side by capitalizing on its rich immigrant history and diverse communities. WEQY will serve the East Side as a community anchor, connecting and sparking dialogue across cultures and generations, educating the public, and broadcasting the voices of the East Side,” according to the website.</p>
<p>Located not far from the college on East Seventh Street, WEQY is important to our Metro State community. The volunteer staff keeps the topics relevant and timely for all Twin Cities residents. However, the airwaves only reach a three mile radius. This gives the station an opportunity to reach out and give the east side a voice it has never had before.</p>
<p>The morning show consists of hip-hop music, and shows such as Democracy Now air on weekdays at 11 a.m., giving residents knowledge of larger national news in addition to global events and how they impact the community. WEQY involves the community to discuss topics that over the years have been taboo – like race – in ways that provoke positive change. By doing this, a dialogue is created in the community that creates a stronger voice.</p>
<p>Because of the diversity throughout the Twin Cities, WEQY is working with other low-power FM stations. So, if you aren’t living in Saint Paul, you can hopefully soon listen to their programming on the radio; or stream it live from the website: weqy.org. You can also find east side neighborhood events on the website.</p>
<p>Because the station takes pride in their neighborhood, they threw a great block party on Saturday, August 13th. Attendees enjoyed food from local venders, local live music and dance performances, and connected with local resources for both businesses and families.</p>
<p>The goal of the station is to give a voice on the airwaves to people who typically don’t have one, such as Latino, Somali, and Hmong residents. Because WEQY is volunteer run, they are open to ideas for new shows, new playlists, and topics to discuss. If you are interested in getting a show or volunteering, visit the WEQY website and view the guidelines.</p>
