<p>At the beginning of the school year, a few inevitable signs of the season’s change: the air becomes cooler; leaves begin to change. The cost of textbooks causes the moans of students to cascade throughout the Twin Cities; and Metro State’s annual tradition, “Fallfest,” jumps onto campus. It happens every year, and the collaboration of student organizations and the University to strive towards bringing the student population together is admirable. It is an event that legitimately combines Metro’s fantastical elements of outward comradery with shades of professionalism. The event is, indisputably, our homecoming. This is our opportunity to invest in passionate clubs and organizations.</p>
<p>About 40 organizations – with bells and whistles – will be in attendance for the September 24th  event. Students, faculty, staff, alumni, and friends of the college are invited to join the fun; naturally, a family event. Closing gaps and building bridges will be at the forefront of the event, with President Ginny Arthur opening the festivities.</p>
<p>When you’re at the event, swing by The Metropolitan Booth and say hello. We would love to see you there!</p>
