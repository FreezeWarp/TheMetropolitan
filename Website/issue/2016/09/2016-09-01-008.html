<p>Discounted bus passes are now available for the Fall 2016 semester. The passes themselves, discounted specifically for Metro State students, are valid from Aug. 15 to Dec. 31. Typically priced at $175, but lowered to a rate of $100.</p>
<p>This pass applies to Metro Transit busses, the Green Line—which stretches from Target Field in Minneapolis to Union Depot in St. Paul through the midway areas—as well as the Hiawatha rail stretching through south Minneapolis. A valid student I.D. is required with the pass when riding, and students should get the pass registered at metrotransit.org/register in case a replacement pass is needed—the replacement is $20 with registration. It’s full price without.</p>
<p>Passes are on a first come first serve basis, but a handful are still available for purchase at these locations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>-Saint Paul Campus</li>
  <li>-Midway Center</li>
  <li>-Minneapolis Campus</li>
  <li>-Brooklyn Park Campus</li>
</ul>
