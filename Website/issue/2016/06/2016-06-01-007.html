<article><p>Summer is here!  The weather is warm, and the sunshine is out.  Longer days are on the horizon.  It’s time for you to put your socks away and get out those flip-flops.  Many exciting adventures and fantastic moments await you.  It’s your chance to create lasting memories that you will recall for years.   This year’s summertime could be your best yet.</p>
<p>Sometimes this season goes by too quickly, though.  And, if you are like me, today’s technology provides a sidetrack from exploring new possibilities.  Modern inventions, such as streaming and smartphones, can divert attention away from real-life experiences.   This year, however, you don’t have to feel regrets over missed opportunities.  </p>
<p>A 2016 Summer Bucket List could help you plan a great summer.  This list has a powerful propensity to make your aspirations come true.  You can place your list in a place where you will see it every day.  It will help you visualize your summer’s outcomes and feel inspired.  This list can feature dates and deadlines for a sense of urgency.</p>

<strong>Spend Time Outdoors</strong>
<p>As I compile my Summer Bucket List, many fun activities come to mind.  Summer is a great time to enjoy the outdoors with family and friends.  From beaches to forest preserves, Minnesota is abundant with nature.  Around our Saint Paul campus, for instance, there are several parks within walking distance.  These places are ideal for hiking or biking—and picnics too.  This summer, I will explore Indian Mounds Park.</p>

<strong>Experience Something New</strong>
<p>If outdoor scenery is not your preference, there are plenty of indoor attractions to see.  The Science Museum of Minnesota may be a consideration for you.  This July, the Museum will present Mummies: New Secrets from the Tombs and two Omnitheater shows—National Parks Adventure and Jerusalem.  In August, I will go to the Minnesota History Center for the first time.  Their exhibit, Minnesota’s Greatest Generation, offers true stories from people that lived during the Depression and World War II.</p>

<strong>Complete a Project</strong>
<p>Besides enjoying recreational activities, I intend to be productive.  Is there a chore that you have been putting off for some time?  Maybe you have something to build or create.  Personally, I have procrastinated on a few assignments.  When writing these duties on paper, I feel anxious.  By completing these projects, I can eliminate anxiety and gain a sense of accomplishment. </p>

<strong>Learn Something New</strong>
<p>With a summer full of events, a person can find meaning through self-improvement.  Reading is an excellent way to acquire new knowledge.  It can also help you improve a skill.  On my Bucket List, I have set a goal to learn a new software program.  This act will help me prepare for the upcoming school year and beyond.  What useful information would you like to find?</p>
