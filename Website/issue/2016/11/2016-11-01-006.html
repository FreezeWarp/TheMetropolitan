<article>
<p>In collaboration with Minneapolis Community and Technical College (MCTC), Metropolitan State’s Theater Underground and Theater programs are premiering two student-written plays as a part of the programs’ playwright contest held every year. Featured in this year’s double bill showing is “Dream Big” by Mark Stewart, and “58 Months” by Benjamin Granger. Both won last year’s playwright contest, and then went through months of development to polish and focus the stories to be stage ready.</p>
<p>“58 Months” is an intimate story focused around a man who has been arrested for numerous hard drug violations. While his family fails him, he seeks solidarity with friends he made in prison. Whereas the former is an unflinching look at the prison system, the latter, “Dream Big,” is an absurdist comedy. It revolves around an archeological dig attended by an energetic student who needs to figure out how to pay for his study abroad.</p>
<p>Both will be performed in a double bill at 7 p.m., Nov. 16-19, at MCTC at the Stagedoor Theater—with a 2 p.m. matinee on Nov. 19. General admission is $10, and students with IDs can attend for free.</p>

<h2>“Urinetown” Casting Call</h2>
<p>In collaboration with Minneapolis Community and Technical College (MCTC), Metro State’s Theater Underground and Theater programs are holding auditions for the musical “Urinetown” for the spring semester production. The Tony Award-winning play by Mark Hollmann and Greg Kotis circles around a town where a 20-year drought has led to a government ban on toilets.</p>
<p>11 multicultural men and women of all ages are needed for casting. To audition, a two-minute monologue, a prepared up-tempo song—ideally from a musical comedy—and a ballad are to be sung without accompaniment. A headshot and resume are encouraged. Dress for movement.</p>

<p>Audition location: Whitney Fine Arts Theatre, F1200</p>
<p>Audition dates: Wednesday, Nov. 30 through Saturday, Dec. 3.</p>
