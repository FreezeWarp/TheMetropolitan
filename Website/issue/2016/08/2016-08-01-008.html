<p>Ayurveda is an ancient Indian method of natural healing. Modern self-help gurus, such as Deepak Chopra, are reintroducing this practice. Today, the practice of Ayurveda is becoming more popular. Joining this new health movement is the Nursing Student Organization.</p>
<p>Last June they held an Ayurveda Seminar, where they presented Reiki Master Tanya Boigenzahn Sowards of Thai Yoga Bodywork. Reiki Masters teach healing methods, and practitioners of Ayurveda believe in the principle of balance. If people are balanced, they will show positive behavioral traits, such as good mood, energy, friendliness and discipline. If people are unbalanced, they will show negative behaviors, such as anxiety, insomnia, difficulty focusing and irritability. There may also be physical symptoms of imbalance. Ayurveda practitioners help others restore their health by educating them on diet, herbs, aromatherapy, massage, music and meditation. Student activities like this one help people learn more about healthy lifestyles.</p>
<p>The Ayurveda Seminar is an example of the programs that the Nursing Student Organization brings to Metropolitan State University. To help you find out more about this organization, The Metropolitan contacted the president of the Nursing Student Organization, Margaret Olatunbosun. In the interview, Olatunbosum describes this student organization and her personal recollections as a member.</p>

<p><strong>1.  What are the goals of your organization?</strong></p>
<p>“The goal of the Nursing Student Organization is multifold: create relationships with internal and external organizations; offer leadership and organizational skills to students involved; and promote wellness to all students through campus events.”</p>

<p><strong>2.  How long has your organization been on campus?  How many members belong to your group?</strong></p>
<p>“We have existed quite a while. The current officers are: the president (Margaret Olatunbosun), vice president (Kelli Gerards), treasurer (Mari Bjerstedt), and secretary (Yeng Lee), and we have been in our respective leadership roles for about 7 months.”</p>

<p><strong>3.  What activities are available for members?</strong></h2>
<p>“Events/activities are decided by members of the organization, dependent on funding and learning opportunities available. These activities are not exclusive to NSO; they are open to Metro State students and staff.”</p>

<p><strong>4.  How many events does your organization have in a year? How many do you present to the students at large?  Are there any events planned shortly?</strong></p>
<p>“It varies. Since the beginning of the year we have co-hosted a blood drive with the Red Cross organization, offered blood pressure screenings at the spring health expo, and this summer we concluded a self-care event and an Ayurvedic seminar. The NSO offers at least one event per semester, and the self-care event has been one of our most popular and successful events.</p>
<p>"We have our Fall Self-Care event coming up in about three months (we try to schedule it before finals week). Last year, vendors provided back massages, Reiki, hand massages and aromatherapy for attendees. Lunch and refreshments were provided, which greatly assisted in increasing participation and attendance. This event gave Metro State students an opportunity to take a break, regroup, and receive a moment of relaxation before beginning the fall finals week. Free raffle tickets were given at each station to help facilitate movement through the event.</p>
<p>"We have many things to consider: students' clinical schedules, external commitments and available funds.”</p>

<p><strong>5.  How has your personal experience with this organization enhanced your college experience?</strong></p>
<p>“Being a part of the NSO has provided us numerous opportunities to learn and network with internal organizations, external health care organizations, and promote Metro State nursing students—not just on campus, but in the community.”</p>

<p><strong>6.  If a student would like to get involved with the Nursing Student Organization, how should he or she join?  Are there any specific requirements?</strong></p>
<p>“The NSO is free to join. You only have to be a member of Metropolitan State University, be willing to volunteer for events, and be able to attend a minimum of three meetings in an academic calendar year (Fall, Spring, Summer).”</p>
