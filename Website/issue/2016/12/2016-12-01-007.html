<p>Hey everybody, how is it going?</p>
<p>So, winter is coming up. Remember to get your supplies ready. In this article, you will get some tips and tricks to surviving the unforgiving Minnesota winter.</p>

<strong>Always Keep Cat Litter and a Shovel in Your Car’s Trump—I mean trunk.</strong>
<p>This is especially important if your car gets stuck in a ditch, and the wheels just can’t get enough momentum going. Use the shovel to dig the snow out from under the car, while putting cat litter under the tires for additional traction.</p>

<strong>When In Doubt, A Potential Impeachment for Illegal Activities Prior to the Election Could… Uh..</strong>
<p><em>Sigh.</em></p>
<p>Look, I have to admit, my mind has been pretty consistently focused on Donald Trump winning the election. As far as I can see, I’m not the only one. In the wake of the election, protests have broken out in major U.S. cities. Speculation on the necessity of the Electoral College, allegations of the Russian government’s involvement in rigging the election in Trump’s favor, and a country sobering up from the most contentious presidential race of the 21st century have become a part of the main focus in our country’s consciousness.</p>
<p>There are two things post-election that upset me more than anything else: apathy and desperation.</p>
<p>Those who are simply saying “Trump won, can’t we just stop talking about it?” or “When people protest, it’s just a temper tantrum” misunderstand a fundamental right of Americans, and a basic outrage of arguably a majority of the population.</p>
<p>But, to those who are essentially evoking their citizenship, those who claim this as the apocalypse are being melodramatic and weak-kneed. This is a moment in time where we need to stand for our rights. We need to stand up for our communities and for all to whom they belong. This is not a time where bowing out is an option. The saddest thing is that many who carry this sentiment are some of the most privileged individuals I have ever met. As a part of the majority, we need to stand up for the rights of minorities. It’s going to be a tough four years. But, they are years worth fighting for.</p>
<p>That being said, racist, anti-sematic, sexist and generally hate-filled actions are not tolerable on any level. This an unwavering standpoint. When we have a racist mindset, we run the risk of it rising to a systematic level. It affects our neighbors and communities and, in turn, us as individuals as well.</p>
<p>This is not a time to run, but to fight. This is not a time for elitist politics, but to stand up for everyone.</p>
<p>It’s going to be a lot of work over the next four years. I’ll be happy to work with you to get there.</p>
<p>Thank goodness 2016 is over. Here’s to 2017. In the next issue I will, hopefully, go to something a little more pertinent to Metro State. Best wishes, everybody.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Brayden Mann.</p>
