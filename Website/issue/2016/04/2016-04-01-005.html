<article><strong>Dear Dr. Kev, 
<p>A very good friend of mine recently set me up with her friend (I'll call her Bre) a smart, funny, beautiful young woman. However, I was hesitant to start dating her as I got out of a serious relationship a couple of months ago and right now I'm just looking to party and have fun for a while. My friend said I should talk to Bre anyways and that we could just start as friends. Well that went out the window after we started flirting and have now gone on a number of dates. So I'm asking for your help for a number of reasons. 1. I do like this girl, but I think she wants something more serious than I do. 2. I'm kind of in "slut mode" right now and want to date lots of people but don't want Bre's feelings to get hurt. 3. I don't think she's the right body type for me. She's very skinny and I go for thick women... like I have more booty than this chick, and that is a problem. What's a confused, superficial guy to do?</p>
<p>Sincerely, I'maJerk</p>

<p>Dear I’maJerk,</p>
<p>You sound like the type of guy who’s upset that Metro State doesn’t have a frat house where you could crush Busch Light with your bros as though it were real beer. The type of dude who mixes his protein shakes with skim milk because its leg day and you’re trying to watch your fat intake. When Spike TV (or whoever) quit airing “The Man Show,” it felt like you lost a both relative and an internal organ. </p>
<p>Clearly there are other aspects of your life that need addressing. Real beer is brewed by hipsters with neck tattoos and comes in a growler, not a 30 pack suitcase. Added bonus: you can tell if it’s cold by touching it- no visual cues needed. And The Man Show was stupid. Most Xtreme Challenge was the only thing worth watching on Spike.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve got that out of the way, you’re situation doesn’t look awful complicated. If you don’t want something serious, tell Bre. And stop it with the slut shaming business.</p>

<h2>Serious?</h2>
<p>Have you tried asking Bre what she is looking for in your relationship? If she’s talking promise rings, a white picket fence, two and a half kids, a dog, and a weird custody battle after your midlife crisis when you buy a sports car to compensate for your Trump-esqe manhood, I would end the relationship now.</p>
<p>That said, maybe she’s just looking for a little short term fun. In that case, make it clear you’re in the same boat.</p>
<p>It sounds like you aren’t ready for another relationship right now. Consider taking some time to get over your last serious relationship before tossing your hat in the dating ring.</p>
<p>I’m not sure why you say you’re in “slut mode,” as though there is something wrong with having sex. It’s, like, a fourth of what we are programed to do as humans. Slut shaming is a bad call, even if it’s directed at yourself. Stop it.</p>

<h2>Body Issues</h2>
<p>You describe Bre as smart, funny and beautiful. You’re gonna cut homegirl out over the booty? That ain’t a good look bro. Real recognize real, and you’re looking pretty unfamiliar right now.</p>
<p>But, if you’re not physically attracted to her, you might as push the big red button on the whole business. Even if the two of you don’t want anything too serious, relationships without mutual attraction have one foot in the grave and the other on a banana peel.</p>
<p>You say you don’t want to hurt Bre’s feelings. A booty-related breakup is absolutely going to hurt her feelings.</p>
<p>If and when you end things, let her down easy. Don’t cite your downstairs disappointment as the main reason for the split.</p>
<p>In short, only YOU can prevent booty-related breakups.</p>


<p>Until next time, I remain:</p>
<p>Your Friend,</p>
<p>Dr. Kev</p>
