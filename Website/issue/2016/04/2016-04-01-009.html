<h2>Metropolitan State to expand bachelor’s degree options offered at North Hennepin </h2>
<p>Starting this fall, students will be able to complete their English and Economics majors at the North Hennepin Community College campus in Brooklyn Park. Communications studies and health systems will be offered in fall 2017 and psychology will begin in fall 2018.</p>
<p>This is an expansion of the partnership in which Metropolitan State offers courses on the NHCC campus to serve students living in the west metro. The current Metropolitan State bachelor degrees in nursing and business administration will continue.</p>
<p>The new programs are in response to increasing demand for degrees at the baccalaureate, bachelor’s and master’s levels.</p>

<h2>Search for Metro State’s new president narrowed to two candidates </h2>
<p>Virginia (Ginny) Arthur and Fernando Delgado have been named as the two semi-finalists in the search for Metropolitan State University’s next president. Arthur has been Metro State’s executive vice president and provost since 2015, and as provost and vice president for academic affairs from 2012 to 2015. Delgado has been vice chancellor for academic affairs and provost University of Wisconsin-River Falls as since 2009.</p>
<p>Minnesota State Colleges and Universities’ (MnSCU) board of trustees will select the next president, and will consider Chancellor Steven Rosenstone’s recommendation at their April 20 meeting. The new president is expected to start by July 1, 2016.</p>


<h2>Rush Line transit study meeting April 19</h2>
<p>Transit options that will potentially affect Metropolitan State’s Dayton’s Bluff campus will be discussed 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. Tuesday, April 19, at the Hayden Heights Library at 1456 White Bear Avenue in Saint Paul.</p>
<p>Portions of White Bear Avenue and Maryland Avenue are being considered as a potential route for light rail transit (LRT) or Bus Rapid transit (BRT). The entire route would connect downtown Saint Paul to White Bear Lake or Forest Lake, or potentially further north. </p>
<p>Input from residents and businesses, who are invited to learn about the transit options and provide feedback, are an important part of the process. Project staff will be available for questions.</p>
<p>Upon requests submitted by Friday, April 8, the Ramsey County Regional Railroad Authority will provide interpreters or reasonable accommodations to persons with disabilities who wish to attend the committee meeting. To submit a request, email info@rushline.org or call 651-266-2760.</p>
