<p>Each year we, the students, spend hundreds of dollars in tuition fees to go toward student life, and decisions about how that money is allocated are made through voting process among faculty and student orgs. A few years back, it was decided that inter-organizational communication about student life should be done through Orgsync, an expensive social media platform where all student organizations have a hub for promoting their values to other students, requesting their annual budgets, and cataloguing different forms and files.</p>

<p>It really is a good resource for students and, if used appropriately, a great place to get a closer look at different student organizations on campus, or at how your money is being spent. However, despite having recently renewed a three year contract for the software in 2014, at a whopping $41, 450, student use of the service remains stagnant. Perhaps that’s because student orgs aren’t using it to full potential, or maybe it’s because Student Life & Leadership hasn’t effectively promoted student use of it.</p>

<p>At present, student training for the platform is done on an individual basis when requested; but I would venture to guess that most students don’t know that this training is something they should request, much less which faculty members to make the request of. A well structured promotional plan, I think, would go a long way in increasing awareness and garnering student use of OrgSync. Events like Fall Fest, an annual week-long event to acclimate new and returning students to the university, are a great space for introducing it vigorously. Promoting one or two large session training throughout the year might not be a bad idea either.</p>

<p>I can’t speak for every Metro student, but after being charged per credit per semester, I for one am beside myself that I’d never been urged to join Orgsync until my third year at the university, and only after joining the newspaper on suggestion from a fellow student. It seems to me that the administration could do a lot more to foster involvement when such lofty purchases are made for my (and your) potential involvement.</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying that Orgsync isn’t a worthy investment. I’m merely asking you, the student, to take a closer look at where your money is being spent. And to urge the faculty members that represent your interests to go the extra mile to ensure that you benefit from the investments they make. If you’re unsatisfied with what you find after taking a look, then do something about it… I know The Metropolitan’s always looking for article contributions *wink*.</p>
