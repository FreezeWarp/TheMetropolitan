<p>I recently had an opportunity to interview Kevin Taylor about his secret to breaking 726 cement bricks in just 96 seconds. As a Metropolitan State University student, I find myself walking from the library to the parking ramp at nights. The question I ask myself when I do not feel safe when I walk in what might seem to be a dangerous place is always the same: “What is the easiest and quickest way I can defend myself?” According to Taylor, the answer is that “It’s all about instant ability.”</p>

<p>In this article, I will share with you what I learned from Kevin Taylor. You will discover how instant ability can help improve one’s life whether it is in defending oneself when something comes up or even when it means one wants to get past their fear.</p>

<p>Taylor describes instant ability as the ability to think and act fast. He says that any individual can use instant ability to break just about anything he or she puts his or her mind to. In order for me to have instant ability, I must bring my instinct and train my mind to act fast, Taylor explains. He says it is hereafter when I may overcome anything that comes in front of me.</p>

<p>“A lot of people wrestle with the fear of their feelings. You have got to train mentally” says Taylor. He thinks fear is what held a lot people back from discovering their real worth. Instant ability can be described as the ability to act without fear, to instinctually make up one’s mind.</p>

<p>Once we understand the physics of what we are capable of doing, one would be amazed at the power that is within humans, Taylor explains. He confirms, saying, “My hand is large but soft as a baby’s butt. You are not training your physical body, it’s your mind that you are training.”</p>

<p>The most beautiful thing about this power of instant ability, overcoming fear and defending oneself in the quickest way possible, is that it is teachable. “I break bricks!” says five-year old Luke, Taylor’s son. Luke is the Youngest Kid Board Breaker. The power of instant ability is that anyone can use it to overcome just about any obstacles in life. “Instant ability helps you to know thyself” says Taylor.</p>

<p>Speaking about defending oneself, Taylor says an individual has got to know what he or she is capable of doing to someone else. In respect to instant ability, if someone tries to attack me I am already prepared to defend myself. “I have broken 726 bricks in 96 seconds. If I am attacked by humans, how many seconds do you think they are going to last?”</p>

<p>But Taylor thinks violence is never the solution to peace and to one’s destiny. “Violence is not the answer. Because you are never going to know what another human possesses. It is not the appearances that will hurt you; it is their mind that will hurt you” says Taylor.</p>

<p>A sixteen-year old Marcus, one of Taylor’s trainees, says, “instant ability helps me to defend myself in the easiest way possible. I recommend it because it gives you confidence, knowing your mind, having that instinct to demonstrate and act fast. It also helps you to overcome fear.”</p>

<p>How can anyone get this power of instant ability? Taylor says instant ability requires three things: ability, insights and training. Within one day of training, anyone can break a brick or two. It’s just that simple when fear is not present.</p>

<p>Once we understand the physics of our abilities, we begin to understand the power you and I hold within us. According to Taylor, “it’s all in the mind and you have got to tap into it. It does not matter how big or small you are, its about training the mind.”</p>

<p>A world record holder in speed brick breaking, Taylor, has been featured on a variety of shows including the Today Show, the Steve Harvey Show, the Arsenio Hall Show and America’s Got Talent.</p>

<p>The beauty of instant ability is not just being able to defend one’s self in the easiest and quickest way possible. The value of having instant ability is that it trains one’s mind to think fast and act faster. Taylor praises martial arts saying, “A martial artist is one thing, one person and one entity. You confirm your own style of martial art.”</p>
