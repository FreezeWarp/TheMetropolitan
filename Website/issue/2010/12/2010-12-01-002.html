<p>As a subgroup of the Diversity Learning Task  Force at Metropolitan State University, Culture Vulture offers a new approach  to cultural programming that involves students, faculty, staff and the  community. The group’s mission is to “connect the Metropolitan State community  with the greater Twin Cities community through events at various cultural  venues.” <br />  </p>
<p>While Culture Vulture focuses primarily on  ethnic cultures, member Dr. Michal Moskow notes, “Culture is anything that  people do or use; food, recreation, music—these are all a part of a person’s  culture.”<br />  </p>
<p>So what events does Culture Vulture produce  and promote? They offer a film series of two films per semester, the first of  which took place on Nov.17 and featured the Emmy award-winning film <em>Dreamkeeper</em>.  The films are intended to entertain and educate audience members on various  cultures. These events are held at Founders Hall Auditorium free of  charge—refreshments are also served.<br />  </p>
<p>In addition to films, there will be opportunities  to attend four community events per semester. Such events may include attending  museums, theater productions, lectures, concerts, art exhibitions, workshops,  cultural fairs, variety shows and sporting events. <br /> The most recent event featured a lecture at  the Museum of Russian Art in Minneapolis. Many times tickets are offered at  discounted rates or for free and group transportation or carpools may be  available. </p>
<p>Head “vulture” Maggie Lorenz (office manager  in the dean of students’ office) stresses the importance of involving students  not only in the group events, but in the planning phase as well. “We are always  working to involve students; we want their perspective on what events are  relevant and of interest,” she said. <br />  </p>
<p>The group meets every two weeks, switching  from morning to afternoon each session to accommodate for any schedule.  Currently the group meets on Wednesdays; however, next semester they will meet  on Thursdays. Meetings are held in Founders Hall on the St. Paul Campus—the next  meeting will be on December 8. <br />  </p>
<p>“Benefits for students joining the group  [are] being able to give input on cultural programming, an opportunity to learn  and great experience to build your resume,” said Lorenz.<br /> </p>
<p>Look out for future events from Culture  Vulture in <em>The Metropolitan</em>, <em>The Catalyst</em>, on the University Web site and on campus.
