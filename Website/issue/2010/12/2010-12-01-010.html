<p>On Friday, November 19, Metropolitan State University held an  open reception hosted by the Gateway Student Services Center. The purpose of  the reception was to give faculty, staff and students a chance to connect with  the Gateway associates and the new interim director, and to learn about the  services Gateway will provide to students.<br /> </p>
<p>Interim Director Kelley Eubanks began  the ceremony by explaining the restructuring within Gateway that has been in  process since 2010. Five associates were hired and underwent an extensive  four-week-long training in the areas of financial aid, records and  registration, student accounts, tuition and fees and customer service. <br /> </p>
<p>Eubanks stressed the  “top-notch, second-to-none customer service” that Gateway will offer students,  including use of four kiosks in the Gateway area on the first floor of  Founder’s Hall. These kiosks, Eubanks explained, will be recommended to  students who want to see or update their accounts quickly. <br /> </p>
<p>The five Gateway associates  continued the ceremony by explaining the mission statement, motto, changes in  the system and the training process itself. <br /> </p>
<p>“[Gateway is committed to] providing  timely, accurate and professional services to students,” said associate Heather  Aune. Through phones, Ask Us! (the application used to communicate  electronically with Gateway) and walk-in appointments, the associates follow  student issues through to resolution. This includes use of investigation,  professional judgment and individual discretion to serve as student advocates. <br /> </p>
<p>“The Gateway motto of ‘listen, guide  and equip’ will be demonstrated through becoming a one-stop service center for  students,” said associate Kristin Nolan. Now students can refer to one place  for addressing questions regarding different departments associated with their  student account. <br /> </p>
<p>The associates adapt Gateway to the  needs of Metropolitan State by following the vision statement of becoming “an  accessible one-stop service center that educates and enables students to  self-serve and reach their educational goals.” <br /> </p>
<p>In addition to  those mentioned above, associates include Beakal Elala, Amiin Harun and Tamara  Merkouris, all dedicated to enhancing services for students and community  awareness of Gateway.<br /> </p>
