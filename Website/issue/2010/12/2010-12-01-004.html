<p>With winter graduation imminent for many seniors at  Metropolitan State University, the grim Minnesota state unemployment rate of  seven percent as of September 2010 may impede the joy of the holiday season for  several students looking for jobs.<br /> </p>
<p>If such is the case  for you, do not allow the economic situation to cause dismay to settle on your  turf. Job opportunities are still available to those who seek employment with  an innovative approach.<br /> </p>
<p>Jocelyn Stone, a  Metropolitan State student and editor-in-chief of <em>The  Metropolitan</em> newspaper used creativity, wit and tenacity to land a  job as associate editor of Experience Life magazine. Stone said she was  determined and focused to secure this position. <br /> </p>
<p>In the midst of her  elation, I asked Stone how she positioned herself to obtain her new job—which  happens to be her dream job. She said she first got out of her comfort zone.  Next she built the confidence within herself to pursue the position. Then she  set out with a specific agenda.<br /> </p>
<p>What Stone did to  get her career started is what all Metropolitan State students are taught to  do. Don’t just think persistence and flexibility; try them.<br /> </p>
<p>According to Susan  Perry, an instructor at Metropolitan State, perseverance is necessary to attain  jobs. And Kathy Graves, also an instructor at Metropolitan State, puts emphasis  on the need to be resilient when seeking job opportunities.<br /> </p>
<p>Keep these ideas in  mind when creating your job-seeking plan of action:<br /> </p>
<p>1. When you get out of your comfort zone, you are assessing  your skills. Decide to spread your wings and take your skills to the next level  by applying them in spite of your fears.<br /> 2. When you build your self-confidence to pursue your goals,  you are saying to yourself, I can do this. Then do it. Start with a plan that  includes tasks to execute your goals.<br /> 3. When you start taking on tasks to pursue your goals, you  are reinforcing the determination to accomplish your goals. <br /> </p>
