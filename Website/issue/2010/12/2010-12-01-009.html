<p>The Student Life and  Leadership Department (SLLD) has long recognized outstanding student groups and  leaders, going back to the President’s Student Leadership Awards starting in  1999. These awards, however (which take place in the spring), don’t highlight  the good work done by the various student organizations and leaders as well as  Student Life would like. <br /> </p>
<p>Starting in the next few months, SLLD is  enacting changes to recognize leaders and or groups for their work monthly with  a small token of appreciation.<br /> </p>
<p>Philip Fuehrer of Student Senate activities  graciously answered questions on the new plans taking shape to further  recognize the efforts of student groups and their leaders:<br /> </p>
<p><strong>When did the idea  first come to you to recognize student groups and leaders?</strong> <br /> We have actually recognized student groups and  individual leaders since 1999 via our annual President’s Student&nbsp;Leadership  Awards dinner.&nbsp; <br /></p>
<p><strong>Why recognize groups and leaders?&nbsp; </strong><br /> While we have the annual awards ceremony  there are plenty of high-quality programs and leadership that occurs throughout  the year.&nbsp;Unfortunately, with the annual awards in the spring, we felt  that some of the events  earlier in the  year get overlooked or forgotten. This is an attempt to keep more events and  individuals’ achievements in the forefront.<br />  </p>
<p><strong>Can a group  submit itself to be considered?&nbsp; </strong><br /> We’re still working out final details but  we’ve always allowed self-nominations in our other awards considerations.<br /> </p>
<p><strong>Who selects the  groups and leaders to be honored and what are the criteria by which groups and  leaders are recognized?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><br /> Again, that’s being finalized, but it’ll  likely consist of a smallish panel of three or four  [judges] including the SLLD director and  maybe the dean of students.<br /> </p>
<p><strong>Was there any  difficulty in getting the school to approve the plan, due to tight budgets or  other obstacles?</strong><br /> No.&nbsp; Other than looking to  provide a small congratulatory gift of some sort—a bookstore certificate or  some such thing—there is really no additional cost associated with the idea.<br /> </p>
<p><strong>Who is the first  group or leader that will be recognized and why? </strong><br /> [It’s] too soon to know.<br /> </p>
<p><strong>When will they be  recognized?&nbsp; </strong><br /> Again, too soon, but we’d certainly like to  have it up and running for the new year.<br /> </p>
<p><strong>Will there be an  actual ceremony and, if so, where will it be held?&nbsp; </strong><br /> For these monthly awards there probably  won’t be any ceremony, but winners will be automatically put into the pool of  nominees for the annual awards each spring.<br /> </p>
<p><strong>What are the  rewards being offered?&nbsp; </strong><br /> I can’t see the awards being anything  above $50 and quite possibly in the $20 to $25 range.&nbsp;Simply a little  bonus to say congratulations and job well done.<br /> </p>
<p><strong>Is  there anything else you think we should know?&nbsp;</strong> <br /> Keep your eyes open for when the program  begins and be sure to nominate those you believe are deserving of the honor.</p>
