<p>Have you ever found yourself opening a closet in your house only to find yourself, several minutes later, digging out of a pile that would put your mother to shame? Each year as winter settles in, I tend to look around my house and become overwhelmed by the sheer mass of things I own. This year was no different.<br /></p>
<p>Over winter break I opened my bedroom closet and was immediately immersed in chaos deeper than a vintage clothing rack at Ragstock. As I sat buried between three piles of clothing, I had to decide what to do with it. It’s easy to become emotionally attached to an object and, if you’re anything like me, your affections run wide and deep. <br /></p>
<p>Of course, knowing when it’s time to let go is the first step of clutter recovery. How do you know what to get rid of and how do you separate the mess? Understandably, finding a place to start can be overwhelming, but the end results will amaze you. <br /></p>
<p>My best recommendation is to pick a room first and start in the corner farthest away from the door. If the room needs a major overhaul, start from the ceiling and work your way to the baseboards. When you come across objects, clothing or other miscellaneous stuff, separate it into four piles: throw, keep, donate and sell. <br /></p>
<p>What do you do with clutter (particularly clothing) that could find a use somewhere else? The easiest thing to do is donate to a local store. Savers, The Salvation Army and Goodwill are all great places that will take your gently used clothing. All three places will give you a receipt with the total amount you believe your things are worth. Keep in mind, however: you must itemize your list if you wish to claim your deductions at tax time. <br /></p>
<p>Making a list is relatively easy; all you need is a pen and a notebook. I recommend separating your clothing into piles: t-shirts, pants, dresses, skirts, lingerie, children’s clothing and so on. By having a list, you can quickly tally each item as you put it into a box or bag. <br /></p>
<p>Consignment shops are great places to take your gently used brand-name clothing as well. There are many to choose from in the Twin Cities. One thing to keep in mind when selling through a consignment shop is that you will generally have to sign some sort of contract. You will be paid a percentage of your clothing as it sells, so if you don’t mind waiting until then, this is a great option.<br /></p>
<p>Another option is to sell things you can’t quite give away on sites like eBay and Craigslist. Remember that eBay is better for smaller items that don’t require expensive shipping, while Craigslist is great if you have a large item for sale or donation (appliances, beds, furniture) that you would need to have picked up by an interested party. <br /></p>
<p>As spring creeps up, I have taken some steps not only to get rid of the clutter, but to also cleanse my spirit. It never fails to impress me how much better I feel when the Tupperware cabinet is organized and I can find a lid to everything, or when the pots and pans stack up neatly and naturally. I am amazed when every article of clothing I own finds itself neatly on a hanger or folded in a drawer. <br /></p>
<p>The inside of my house is finally starting to resemble a home and the feng shui has once again started to flow gently through the space. As the snow melts and the grass begins to grow, my thoughts drift to the next step of clutter recovery: having a garage sale.<br /></p>
