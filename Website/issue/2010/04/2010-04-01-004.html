<p>When Metropolitan State University was founded in 1971, it was very much like several non-traditional schools where classes and curriculum were decidedly alternative and lax—one might say, “anti-establishment.” For instance, back then, instructors gave written evaluations of students’ coursework instead of letter grades. <br /></p>
<p>Thankfully, much of the “hippie era” (as some staff and students refer to it) is long gone and the University’s academic standards and coursework have become quite rigorous, commensurate with that of higher-profile universities in Minnesota.<br /></p>
<p>But one important and prestigious element of traditional university education has lacked a cohesive approach here at Metropolitan State: honors at graduation. The Latin honors system is widely used at universities and colleges across the United States and provides a baseline for recognition of exceptional academic work. The formal distinction is very often included on a graduate’s diploma from his or her institution.<br /></p>
<p>But not at Metropolitan State.<br /></p>
<p><strong>More equal than others?</strong><br /> As Student Senate president Melissa Heinz explains, Metropolitan State’s current honors program actually has unequal recognition standards from one college to the next. Under the current system (contained in University Procedure #252), graduates are evaluated not by their overall g.p.a., but instead by their rank among the top 10 percent of graduates from their respective college (College of Management, College of Professional Studies, etc.). Also, honors graduates are recognized only by verbal mention at commencement. The distinction is not included on their diplomas.<br /></p>
<p>After researching the issue, Heinz and other members of the Student Senate prepared petitions in January to gauge students’ interest in a formal Latin honors program at Metropolitan State. The response has been staggering.<br /></p>
<p><strong>Remarkable demand</strong><br /> Initially, Heinz was hoping to get 500 students to sign on to the effort, but that goal was met after less than a month of publicity work. As of this writing, more than 1,300 students have signed the petition asking University administration to adopt a formal Latin honors program and the signatures are still coming.<br /></p>
<p>Now Heinz and the Student Senate are working to obtain formal endorsement of their petition and proposal from the Inter Faculty Organization, the group that handles collective bargaining for the University’s full and associate professors. <br /></p>
<p>While the formal approval will come too late for students graduating this spring, Heinz is hoping that current and future students will have the chance to earn traditional Latin honors upon graduating from Metropolitan State University.<br /></p>
<p><strong>What can you do?</strong><br /> If you support the Student Senate’s efforts to institute a Latin honors program at Metropolitan State but have not yet signed the petition, the Senate expressly welcomes your interest and input; their contact information is provided below. Faculty, academic advisors and department leadership support will be required for administration to seriously consider the issue, so you might want to have a conversation about Latin honors with your own professors and advisors. The Metropolitan will follow as this story unfolds in the next few months.<br /></p>
