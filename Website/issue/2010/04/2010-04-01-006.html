<p>A study published earlier this year titled “Squeeze Play 2010,” found that the American public is growing skeptical about whether higher education institutions are concerned about the educational experience of students. Instead, six out of 10 Americans surveyed believe colleges and universities are more concerned about the bottom line. <br /> </p>
<p>Over half of survey respondents believe colleges could spend less, maintain or lower tuition, and still offer a high quality education. Metropolitan State University may be able to offer the Twin Cities community an affordable education, but does that come at the cost of quality? “Metropolitan State University has a long-standing commitment to offering quality education at an affordable price,” says Metropolitan State President Sue Hammersmith. <br /> </p>
<p>Serving over 9,000 students, the University boasts tuition rates that are half the cost of attending the University of Minnesota. Additionally, Metropolitan State is the least expensive university in the entire Twin Cities area, with tuition that is two to six times less than that of other institutions. <br /> </p>
<p>President Hammersmith states that Metropolitan State does not sacrifice the quality of education by focusing on the university’s core mission, which is to provide quality education for adult students. “We don’t have athletics, fancy facilities, fraternities and sororities, residential housing or a recreation or fitness center,” says President Hammersmith. “All those things cost money, and at many public universities a student will pay hundreds of dollars a year in special fees to support such resources as athletics, health centers or fitness centers.”<br /> </p>
<p>The number of Americans who perceived higher education as necessary for success has increased from 31 percent in 2000 to 55 percent in 2009. The study suggests that this is a result of the nation moving into a “knowledge-intensive workplace economy,” thus driving more people to seek higher education rather than things such as on-the-job training. <br /> </p>
<p>With this perception in mind, the study also found that 69 percent of the public believe that a college education is out of reach for qualified people, possibly due to rising tuition rates. Sixty-five percent of survey respondents say that they believe higher education prices are intensifying at faster rates compared to other costs. <br /> </p>
<p>Metropolitan State has long been known for providing a quality education at affordable prices. But analysts of the survey believe the public is unaware of the internal struggles colleges and universities go through, including financially. If this is true, institutions need to work harder to ensure Americans have access to and can understand the needs of the colleges. <br /> </p>
<p>“Whenever I have the opportunity to talk to the public or with community leaders, I make sure they understand that Metropolitan State is probably a model when it comes to higher education because we offer high quality education at the lowest tuition rates,” President Hammersmith assures. <br /> </p>
<p>President Hammersmith states that the University is doing all that it can to help keep tuition rates low for students, including reducing professional travel, institutional memberships, library hours and acquisitions, increasing class sizes and academic advisors’ case loads and reducing waste such as electricity and paper. Additionally, the University has asked faculty and staff to serve more students without additional resources. <br /> </p>
<p>“We owe all of the faculty and staff enormous gratitude for what they’ve done without additional resources,” says Hammersmith. <br /> </p>
<p>Although the survey found much skepticism from survey respondents, the study did conclude that the American public is not going to turn its back on higher education. People still believe that higher education is an important part of American society. In addition, parents who were surveyed still believe their children will one day attend college and are hopeful that their children will be able to find funding to attend college, even if that funding is in the form of loans. <br /></p>
