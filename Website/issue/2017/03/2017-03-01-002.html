<p>You may have your creative aspirations. If I may ask, what are they?  Perhaps you have a dream to write a book or produce an interesting video. Maybe you would like to compose a poem or take an inspiring photograph. Whatever it is, would it be exciting to have one of your artistic productions printed in a magazine or displayed on a website?</p>

<p>If you are a Metropolitan State student, alumnus, faculty or staff member, there is an opportunity for your work to appear in an upcoming edition of the Haute Dish for the summer of 2017. Haute Dish is an arts and literature publication for Metro State. Imagine the satisfaction you will feel when you show your published piece to friends and family.</p>

<p>The Haute Dish staff is currently accepting submissions for their next issue. They are anxiously awaiting your submission. The Staff would like to see what your imaginative mind and motivated heart can produce. The deadline to turn in your creation is <strong>April 15, 2017, at 11:59 p.m.</strong></p>

<p>Are you ready to start your personal journey to getting published? Your journey begins with a first step. Here is a step-by-step guide to getting your work considered for the next Haute Dish magazine.</p>

<h2>Step One: Discover Your Genre and Decide what Type of Piece You Would Like to Create.</h2>
<p>You can find the online versions of the Haute Dish magazine at <a href="http://hautedish.metrostate.edu">hautedish.metrostate.edu</a>. View the entries to see the work that the Haute Dish accepts. Doing so may help you consider your strengths and determine the work you would like to do. Artists find success through passion and enjoyment of their creative labors. Projects such as a memoir/personal essay, poetry piece, fiction story, nonfiction narrative, digital storytelling video, photograph and illustration are available.</p>

<h2>Step Two: Examine the Guidelines to Ensure that Your Submission Will Fit the Required Specifications.</h2>
<p>Work turned into the Haute Dish must be original and not previously used in other publications. Also, the work must be an approved file length and format. Writings, for instance, cannot exceed 3000 words and poems must be limited to 40 lines. Videos must have an MP4 or MOV file format. Please visit hautedish.submittable.com/submit for up-to-date submission rights and requirements.</p>

<h2>Step Three:  Have Fun, and Create Your “Masterpiece.”</h2>
<p>Many people initiate stress working on this type of project. They might lose sight of the fun of the process by focusing too much on the result. Even in the most optimal environments, it is possible to lose creative inspiration. Sometimes our artistic energies are low. The difficulties may cause us to lose motivation in our ventures. At these times, it is best to put the project on hold until you can tackle it with a different mindset. Coming back to the project, you will be amazed how much better things will flow.</p>

<h2>Step Four: Edit Your Final Piece Continuously to Make It Your Best Work.</h2>
<p>A popular misconception of writers is that their efforts come easy. Exceptional writers deliver outstanding work with a dedication to effort and extensive editing. Before submitting your piece, take the time to review work repeatedly. It may also be helpful to get others to view your work. You will be surprised to discover a necessary alteration after each review. Your attention to details will be the difference between a good creation and the best creation from you.</p>

<h2>Step Five: Submit your Final Piece and Cover Letter Before the Deadline.</h2>
<p>You will want to give yourself enough time to complete the project punctually. Submissions received after the deadline will not be considered for the summer issue. Along with your final piece, you will need to provide a cover letter. This page should include your name, status at Metro State and a short (fewer than 150 words) biography about yourself.</p>

<p>Haute Dish also requires users to use their Metro State email with their communications. You can submit all of your submissions (up to 4 in each genre) electronically through <a href="http://hautedish.submittable.com/submit">the submission page</a>. Remember to exclude your name from the pieces to be considered. The editors prefer to vote without the influence of names.</p>

<p>Good luck with your goal of getting published in the next Haute Dish magazine. I hope your submission will get selected. If your submission is not selected, please remember that Haute Dish publishes the magazine three times a year.</p>
