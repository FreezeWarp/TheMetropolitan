<p>Saint Paul’s east side has a lot to offer when it comes to wining, dining and shopping. Here are a few options.</p>

<h2>Restaurants</h2>
<h3>Tongue in Cheek—989 Payne Avenue, St Paul; Phone: <a href="tel:16518886148">651-888-6148</a></h3>
<p>Tongue in Cheek has been using the best animal and seafood products since June of 2014. The products are raised and caught humanly and sustainably. They offer quality food at a reasonable price, and the passion and appreciation is shown in the dishes. Tongue in Cheek has a casual feel with fine dining characteristics, so you don’t have to worry about dressing up too much. But do expect some fancy food.</p>

<h3>Hamburguesa El Gordo—990 Payne Avenue, St. Paul; Phone: <a href="tel:16513401483">651-340-1483</a></h3>
<p>Hamburguesa El Gordo is a small restaurant that has come a long way. Known for serving large burgers, their cuisine specializes in Northern Mexican street food. The success of what started as a home business led to the opening of their restaurant doors in November 2015. They offer a new experience to Metro students that is difficult to get in Minnesota. The cost of a meal will cost a customer $15 to $20, but they use fresh ingredients and make the meals fresh to order. Every Friday, if customers buy 3 burgers they get the 4th one free. Hamburguesa El Gordo also offers call in orders for pick up—just in case Metro students don’t have much time in between classes.</p>

<h3>Cooks—949 Payne Avenue, St. Paul; Phone: <a href="tel:16517561787">651-756-1787</a></h3>
<p>Cooks is a newer restaurant and has been nominated for a new business award. They serve locally sourced food and focus on classic American diner food, some with a Korean twist. The restaurant is only available for breakfast and lunch throughout the week. But on Fridays they provide Korean dinners from 5-9 p.m., presenting a new cook and menu each week. Cooks offers the highest quality with fresh ingredients.</p>


<h2>Drinks</h2>
<h3>Ward 6—858 Payne Avenue, St. Paul; Phone: <a href="tel:16513488181">651-348-8181</a></h3>
<p>Ward 6 is a bar that is immersed in the east side community. The menu is full of delicious pub food and enjoyable drinks. If drinks are what you want, they have a variety of wine and beers much like other bars. What sets them apart are the adult milkshakes, amusing cocktails and shots. Food is served up to an hour before they close, and they are open for brunch on the weekends from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. Ward 6 also hosts a handful of shows a couple of times a month. More information on the artists presented can be found on their website.</p>

<h3>Sidhe Brewing—652 Jenks Avenue, St. Paul; Phone: <a href="tel:16514241534">612-424-1534</a></h3>
<p>Sidhe is a welcoming brewery that believes there is a craft beer for everyone. The owner started as a home brewer and now has her own store front on the east side. On Fridays and Saturdays Sidhe offers $2 off for happy hour. The store carries 10 curious beers, from ale to pilsner. Sidhe’s motto is: “Brewed by women, loved by all.”</p>

<h3>Caydence Records and Coffee—900 Payne Avenue, St. Paul; Phone: <a href="tel:16513405128">651-340-5128</a></h3>
<p>Caydence is a delightful coffee shop that is new to the neighborhood, having only been in business for five months. The interesting pairing of records with coffee is as fresh as they are. It’s as if a record store and a coffee shop had a baby. The experience of sipping espresso while flipping through their vinyl selection is quite relaxing. This new combination seems as though it has been plucked from a hipster’s dreams.</p>


<h2>Shops</h2>
<h3>Art Gallery and Oddities—1129 Payne Avenue, St Paul; Phone: <a href="tel:16512307767">651-230-7767</a></h3>
<p>Art Gallery and Oddities is well known in the community and has been a featured article in the Pioneer Press. Their gallery portion of the store shows local artists work and hosts monthly shows. Viewing the art is a delightful and relaxing experience. It’s also inspiring to be surrounded by so much great local work. The oddities portion is unique and something to behold. They carry an array of items, from taxidermy to crystals. When you’re feeling adventurous or need to get a gift for someone who has everything, this is definitely the place to go.</p>

<h3>Dulceria Bonbon Candy Boutique—882 Payne Avenue, St Paul; Phone: <a href="tel:16512496565">651-249-6565</a></h3>
<p>Dulceria Bonbon is a dream come true for sweet tooths and candy lovers alike. The store is filled with bright colors and fun, festive delectables. They carry Mexican, American and artesan candies, as well as ice cream and piñatas. This unique store deserves a good look.</p>\

<h3>San Miguel Bakery—886 Payne Avenue, St. Paul; Phone: <a href="tel:16517743110">651-774-3110</a></h3>
<p>San Miguel Bakery is a very understated store. But as soon as you walk in, your eyes go straight to the walls filled with fresh made pastries. Some pastries look familiar: sugar-topped, jelly-filled, flaky crust. But others look like nothing I have ever seen before. They are all worth a taste and offer a great chance to try something new. The baked goods cost about a dollar a piece (you must spend $5 to use a credit card), so it doesn’t cost a lot to really experience part of a culture.</p>
