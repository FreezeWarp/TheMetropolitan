<p>The Metro State Breaking Club made its campus debut at the Monte Carlo Night on April 28. In front of a Student Center audience, Kevin Vang, Genny Moua and Robert Thao performed their signature break dancing moves.</p>

<p>The crowd applauded the dancers’ impressive steps, spins, flips and freezes. Soon, the audience broke away from their card games to join the excitement. They learned new techniques and had fun showing off their dance skills</p>

<p>Kevin Vang, the founder of this new student organization, felt something was missing at Metro State. “I wanted to bring something fresh and new to the university,” he said. Vang, also known as Bboy Keej, has been break dancing for seven years.</p>

<p>He started when he was a freshman in high school. Now, Vang is an instructor at House of Dance Twin Cities, a center for hip-hop and break dancing. There he discovered his passion for teaching. He enjoys seeing students learn new skills and display their individuality.</p>

<p>Besides instructing, Vang is also a competitive break dancer. As a member of the <a href="http://facebook.com/mnicystyles">Icy Styles Crew</a>, Vang travels to tournaments that pit five-member teams against each other.</p>

<p>Videos of tournament competition are available on the <a href="http://youtube.com/user/IcyStylesCrew">Icy Styles Crew’s YouTube page</a>, including their semifinal matchup versus the Majestic Crew at the Patrick Henry Jam in Minneapolis</p>

<p>Vang plans to attend the Freestyle Session Minnesota Qualifier over Memorial Day weekend at the Fine Line Music Cafe in Minneapolis. At this competition, contestants will clash for top prizes including cash, trophies, Soundset Music Festival tickets, and entry to the Freestyle Session World Finals</p>

<p>In addition to competing, Vang also performs at community events. Many organizations seek dance teams to entertain crowds at gatherings. From whirling windmills to beautiful backspins, audiences enjoy the originality and creativity of break dancing routines. Recently, the Hopkins Police Department requested a House of Dance performance team for a summer get-together at the Hopkins Center for the Arts.</p>

<p>Starting this summer, Vang will offer breaking workshops at Metro State. These seminars will feature guest B-boys and B-girls that have competed at the national level. At Monte Carlo Night, Vang introduced his crewmate Genny Moua, also known as Zony. At Jam for Food 2017, Zony won the “Most Valuable Breaker” award. He also propelled the Icy Styles Crew to a second place finish in the event’s five-on-five breaking competition. </p>

<p>The Metro State Breaking Club meets on Mondays from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. at the Student Center on the St. Paul campus. You can find them in the cafeteria. During the first hour, participants will learn basic moves and discuss break dancing culture and lifestyle. Then, students will practice while Vang provides coaching and encouragement.</p>

<p>According to the club’s OrgSync page, break dancing is a sport that encourages personal development through cardio, strength and mental training. Many breakers find that learning the sequences requires hard work, dedication and determination.</p>

<p>While breakers can acquire moves by watching tutorials on YouTube, they will probably notice greater improvement by practicing with others. Breaking Club members will challenge and inspire each other to improve</p>

<p>The Monday club meetings feature more than an educational experience. For music lovers, there will be a mix of tunes played during the dance routines. The beats motivate and move members to perfect their performance. “We play old-school hip-hop remixed with sounds from cultural music,” Vang said</p>

<p>Meetings are also great opportunities to meet fellow students, develop friendships on campus and get involved in the broader Twin Cities breaking community. Members will receive notifications of local competitions to attend as participants or spectators</p>

<p>If you are interested in becoming a B-girl or B-boy, the Metro State Breaking Club wants to meet you! Even if you don’t want to dance, attend a meeting to take a break from your coursework and cheer on great breakers.
