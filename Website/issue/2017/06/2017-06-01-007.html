They are out exploring all the Twin Cities have to offer, and they’re a fount of ideas for summer fun. Check out their recommendations for activities and events</p>

<h2>Trail Blazers</h2>
<p>Kal Tuominen, community faculty member in the department of natural sciences, is teaching NSCI 201 Minnesota Ecology and Conservation Biology this summer. They recommend students take a hike “a bit outside the Twin Cities.</p>

<p>“People who want to get out of the city for a few hours, or even for a few days, will find a lot to do at Afton State Park.  This is my first choice when I want to go for an intense hike without driving too far!” Tuominen said.</p>

<p>The park offers 20 miles of hiking trails, including 0.6 miles that are wheelchair accessible.  Terrain varies from flat to steep.</p>

<p>Tuominen points to the park’s “excellent examples” of deciduous forest, former pine plantation, oak savannah and restored prairie. </p>

<p>Park activities include camping, picnicking,  swimming and fishing in the St. Croix River, volleyball, horseshoes and geocaching. An archery range will be open on June 10 and July 15. </p>

<p>Afton State Park is about a 30-minute drive east from the St. Paul campus. A one-day vehicle permit costs $5.  A twelve-month permit is $25 and allows access to all 75 Minnesota state parks and recreation areas. Entry is free on June 10 in celebration of “National Get Outdoors Day.” For more information about Afton State Park, see <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/afton/index.html">dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/afto</a></p>

<h2>Gallery Gazers</h2>

<p>Erica Rasmussen, Metro State studio arts professor, encourages students to explore the field of fiber arts at the Textile Center in Minneapolis.</p>

<p>She recommends an exhibition by award-winning, internationally exhibited fiber artist Barbara Lee Smith.  The show is titled “That’s How the Light Gets In: Reflections on Transitions.” It features large landscapes and abstract works crafted with paint, collage materials and sewing machine stitches.</p>

<p>“Through meditative landscapes and abstract compositions, this show provides a rich visual experience that ruminates upon place and memory,” Rasmussen said.</p>

<p>Smith’s work is on display until June 24 in the Joan Mondale Gallery at the Textile Center, 3000 University Avenue SE, Minneapolis.</p>

<p>Hours are 10 a.m. - 7 p.m, Monday to Thursday; 10 a.m. - 5 p.m. Friday and Saturday. Admission is free. For more information, visit <a href="http://textilecentermn.org/barbara-lee-smith-thats-how-the-light-gets-in/">textilecentermn.org/barbara-lee-smith-thats-how-the-light-gets-in/</a></p>

<h2>Road Racers</h2>

<p>Economics professor Allen Bellas is an avid cyclist who commutes by bike to campus. He urges students to take two wheels to see the sights.</p>

<p>“I love riding on the Midtown Greenway in Minneapolis.  It runs from West River Parkway—a great place to ride, too—and East 27th Street to the north side of Lake Calhoun. From there you can continue on to Hopkins and points west,” said Bellas.</p>

<p>But he doesn’t want you to whiz right through. “Along the way you can enjoy the view from the Sabo Bridge; get coffee, pastries and repairs at the Midtown Bike Center; or have a meal at the Midtown Market,” he said.  </p>

<p>Even inexperienced or out-of-practice riders are good to go on the Greenway. “Greenway users are tremendously diverse and you'll see everything from serious bikers to kids just learning to ride and everyone in between,” said Bellas.</p>

<p><a href="http://midtowngreenway.org/files/mgc/ckfinder/files/PrintableMap(1).pdf">For a printable map of the Greenway, try this link</a></p>

<p>But if you’re more of a watcher than a rider, how about seeing the fastest human-powered sport on Earth? Bellas highly recommends the Thursday Night Lights bike races at the National Sports Center Cycling Velodrome in Blaine.</p>

<p>Races run Thursday evenings at 7 p.m. through September 14, weather permitting.  Adult tickets are $5; kids under age 12 are free. See <a href="http://velodrome.nscsports.org">velodrome.nscsports.org</a> for more information.</p>
