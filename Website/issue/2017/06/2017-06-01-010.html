<p>The Metro State Distance-Learning/Intellectual Property Committee of faculty read with interest C.T. Corum’s article, titled “Breaking the Piggy Bank: Why Online Classes Cost More Money Than Traditional Classes” in your March 2017 issue. </p>

<p>Our committee was disappointed that no faculty were interviewed for this piece, because we work hard to advocate for improvements to online learning. These include: ADA accommodation needs in online courses for students (e.g., closed captioning, universal design); SCORM (Sharable Content Object Reference Model) for ensuring content functions consistently across the learning management system; an online orientation for students new to online coursework; and course templates for consistency of navigation and user experience as students move from course to course. </p>

<p>We would very much like the student body to know that our faculty committee has reviewed and questioned the development of extra technology fees associated with online learning. As a committee, we have advocated regularly for the most effective, economical, and efficient uses of any tuition differentials that may be needed for online and hybrid courses.</p>

<p>If any student would like to speak with our committee regarding our committee’s research on this issue and our proposals for examining the use of tuition differentials for improving student success, please feel free to contact Professor Carolyn Whitson, our committee’s chair, at carolyn.whitson@metrostate.edu</p>

<p></p>

<p>Sincerely</p>

<p>Metro State Faculty Distance-Learning/Intellectual Property Committe</p>
