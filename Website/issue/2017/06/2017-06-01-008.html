<p>The driving force behind Google Drive is the idea of “Save Here. Access Anywhere.” Any file you save to your Google Drive will be accessible to you from any device, including your PC and smartphone .</p>

<p>As a student, you can use this service to write and submit papers, projects and reports every semester. Once you save it in Google Drive, you will never lose your work. This feature makes Google Drive a more secure option than storing your papers on USB flash drives that are easily misplaced</p>

<p>If you have a Google or Gmail account, it’s easy to get started with Google Drive. Go to google.com/drive and sign in with your Google account.</p>

<p>Every user gets 15 GB of storage space, which should be more than enough for all the papers you will write until you graduate.</p>

<p>Google Drive’s most powerful features are its online syncing, collaboration, and software suite (Google Docs, Sheets and Slides).</p>

<h2>Sync Your Files</h2>
<p>Google Drive features an easy-to-use file syncing tool for laptop and desktop computers.</p>

<p>After downloading Google Drive (google.com/drive/download), a special folder is created whose contents are automatically synced to your online Google Drive account. You can access, edit, download and collaborate on those files by logging into your Drive account from any device.</p>

<p>Press the blue “NEW” button to create subfolders for all of your classes inside your main Google Drive folder. Then upload your papers to the proper folder and they will be automatically saved and synced to the web.</p>

<p>Working on your papers while they are synced will ensure that you can access your papers even if you leave your USB flash drive or laptop at home—or, worse, your computer breaks</p>

<h2>Collaborate with Classmates</h2>
<p>For your group projects, Google Docs lets your team members collaborate on documents in real time. You can see what your classmates are writing in the group paper, and you can easily edit and make changes.</p>

<p>Since Google Docs is a web-based service, you do not  need to install any software on your computer. Giving a class presentation? Use Google Slides. Tracking stats on a spreadsheet? Try Google Sheets</p>

<h2>Save and Share Freely</h2>
<p>Sharing files you create on Google Drive is as simple as sending an email. Enter the email address of the recipient, and then they can view, edit and collaborate on that file.</p>

<p>You can attach the files to your emails or integrate them into various web apps like Slack (a cloud-based collaboration tool). Files can be saved in different formats like Microsoft Word and PDF, which makes it easy to send them to people who do not use Google Drive</p>

<h2>Not the Only Service Under the Sun</h2>
<p>If you do not get the hang of Google Drive, try out Microsoft OneDrive. You’ve probably come across OneDrive on Metro State campus computers.</p>

<p>Like Google Drive, OneDrive provides online syncing, collaborating and 5 GB of storage. Also, OneDrive provides online versions of Word, Excel and PowerPoint. Office 365 subscribers, including Metro State students, have access to 1 terabyte (1,000 GB) of storage.</p>

<p>For more information on the advantages of Office 365, check out Levi King’s article from <a href="http://themetropolitan.metrostate.edu/issue/2015/06/005">June 2015</a></p>

<p>The main difference between these two services is the user interface. Google Drive provides a much simpler and easier-to-use interface, which OneDrive lacks.</p>

<p>Due to this, I’ve found many Metro State students prefer using Google Drive. Collaborating on a group project through Google Docs was a great experience for me and my teammates last semester in our ICS 382 Computer Security class. Having our files and papers synced automatically was a very handy feature as we multitasked on a tight schedule</p>
