<p>This summer, Metro State students are broadening their worldviews using the teachings of a 19th-century education movement in IDST 323 Chautauqua: Sense of Place.</p>

<p>Dr. Carol Lacey, associate professor in the College of Individualized Studies (CIS), created this new interdisciplinary course. She modeled it on the spirit of the Chautauqua Institution, an innovative liberal arts program that is more than 140 years old. She incorporated what she learned from attending the Chautauqua Institution summer season in 2016 in southwestern New York</p>

<p>Lacey welcomes students from any major to enroll in the online course. It can be used to satisfy goal 5, goal 10 and upper-division Liberal Studies.</p>

<p><strong>Multisided Syllabu</strong></p>

<p>Asked how the class differs from WRIT 532 Writing About Place, Lacey said that her students first consider a personal experience in a place that is specific and significant to them.</p>

<p>Class exercises push students beyond casual observations. They must explore physical, economic, social, cultural and spiritual aspects. They must tackle ecological and environmental challenges, and evaluate the sustainability of their chosen place.</p>

<p>The expansive, multidisciplinary nature of the class generates big questions: What was this place before you laid eyes on it? What could it become? How can an individual make an impact on future generations?     </p>

<h2>Historical Roots</h2>
<div class="factHighlight aside">
<p><strong>chau·tau·qua  </strong>\shǝ-tȯऒ-kwǝ</p>

<p><em>n.</em> (1873) : any of various traveling shows and local assemblies that flourished in the U.S. in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, that provided popular education combined with entertainment in the form of lectures, concerts, and plays, and that were modeled after activities at the Chautauqua Institution of western New York</p>

<p>The Chautauqua Movement began in 1874 with the work of Methodist Church leader John Heyl Vincent and businessman Lewis Miller. They convened at Lake Chautauqua in New York to build an organization, which offered lifelong learning opportunities to the public. It was modeled after an earlier adult education program, the Lyceum Movement</p>

<p>To serve those who could not afford to attend college, the Chautauqua Movement offered correspondence courses. The Chautauqua Literary and Scientific Circle (CLSC) book club encouraged participants to form local reading circles</p>

<p>Chautauqua caught on. By World War I, groups had organized across the U.S. Traveling Chautauquas offered programs under tents or pavilions. They brought educational lectures, entertainment and cultural enlightenment to isolated communities. Audiences could learn about scientific discoveries, receive a deeper religious education, listen to famous orators, or enjoy music concerts. Women, teachers and those living in remote areas benefitted most from these programs.</p>

<p><strong>Influential Model</strong></p>

<div class="slider" data-source="Chautauqua Institution" data-caption="The “Amp,” the open-air amphitheater at the Chautauqua Institution, New York, can accommodate over 6,000 people. It offers a wide-ranging slate of theater, orchestra, opera, popular music and dance programs."><img src="images/2017-06-01-000-2.jpg" /></div>
<p>The Chautauqua Movement’s influence can be seen in the development of summer school, university extension, correspondence courses and “great books” discussions.</p>

<p></p>

<p>As the Great Depression began, the Chautauqua revivals diminished. Radio, automobiles and the shift from rural to metropolitan living all contributed to the decline</p>

<p>But in spite of these cultural changes, the original Chautauqua Institution still draws thousands to summer programs on its 750-acre campus every year. It continues to play a unique role offering studies ranging from the recreational level to the professional. </p>

<h2>Modern-day Minnesota</h2>
<p>Dr. Lacey noted that vibrant Chautauqua-style programs continue to pop up across Minnesota too.</p>

<p>St. Catherine University in St. Paul has offered a summer Chautauqua with renowned speakers, faculty presentations and alumnae involvement. The Arts Access Chautauqua in Minneapolis in 2015 assembled artists to discuss accessibility and disabilities.</p>

<p>By gathering Metro State students under the ‘big tent’ of IDST 323, Lacey keeps the Chautauqua tradition alive.</p>
