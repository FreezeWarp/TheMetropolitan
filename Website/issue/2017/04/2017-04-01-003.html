<p>Spring break is over. How was your break this year? Are you refreshed and ready for the second half of the semester? In the next few weeks, Metropolitan State students, like you, will quickly approach deadlines. Time will tick away as you prepare for exams and write your final papers. Speaking of papers, how is yours coming along? Did you start it? If you need help, the Metro State Library is a great place to begin.</p>
<p>Many students flock to the library during final exam season, a quiet place where you can focus and concentrate. At home, distractions may hinder your momentum to tackle challenging assignments. In the library, you will be in the company of students working hard at their studies. Their dedication will inspire you to move forward and produce excellent results.</p>
<p>Besides being an ideal location for study, your Metro State Library has several useful resources. Have you visited this facility lately? If not, this article will help you discover what you are missing. Here are five things you may not know your Metro State Library provides:</p>

<p>Information, Information and Even More Information</p>
<p>You may know that the Metro State Library has many books and periodicals to peruse. Did you know that you also have access to 128 information databases? These individual catalogs contain specific information that corresponds to a particular area of study. For instance, the “MEDLINE” database has health science and medical news. The “Computer Database” source has the latest information on computers and technology. To retrieve these databases yourself, go to the libguides.metrostate.edu/az.php webpage. This site will bring you to Research Guides. I enjoy using The New York Times Historical Database. This resource is my “time machine” to view editorials and advertisements as they appeared years ago.</p>
<p>You may not have time to go through these databases individually. On the right-hand sidebar you will notice a “One Search” box. This search engine will help you find articles fast. Once you locate the desired article there should be a link to read the full text online. Most articles also let you email, download, print or save the document for future access. Articles typically include citation tools to help you complete a bibliography.</p>
<p>After using “One Search”, I feel this will be your go-to place to find information. It will help you save time and also guide you toward scholarly publications that are useful and accurate. You may get different results using Google.</p>


<h2>Online Access to a Librarian</h2>
<p>Some difficulties may develop when searching for data. Did you know that librarians assist students online? You can find a text box on the library’s homepage to submit your question to a librarian. This text box is also at the Research Guides webpage mentioned previously in this article. If you prefer, you can send them an email at <a href="mailto:library.services@metrostate.edu">library.services@metrostate.edu</a>. They may help you find something, access archives or arrange an interlibrary loan request.</p>


<h2>Access to Other Resources</h2>
<p>As you work on your school projects, there may be things you need. For instance, you may need a laptop, digital camera, voice recorder or calculator. Did you know that students can check out these items at the Metro State Library? You may also need access to a particular computer program. At the Metro State Library, and other campus computer labs, you may find software such as Adobe Photoshop and IBM SPSS to add professionalism to your work. If you are working on a group task, a meeting room may be beneficial. You can reserve and view study room availability online at <a href="mplus.mnpals.net/booking/patron_MTR_005881814.html">MNPals</a>.</p>


<h2>Fun Events</h2>
<p>Besides laboring on your coursework, the Metro State library has fun activities for you. During the year, the library hosts events for the Dayton’s Bluff Book Club and Third Tuesday Game Nights. They also have a Teens Know Best book club for teens. To view upcoming library events, click on the UPCOMING LIBRARY EVENTS button in the <a href="http://www.metrostate.edu/student/learning-resources/learning-resources/library-and-information-services/events-and-programs">events and programs section</a>. The next game night event will be April 18 from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. in the first-floor library lounge. Game night events feature many board and video games.</p>


<h2>Excellent Accessibility</h2>
<p>You can gain entry to all library services by going to the Metro State Library and Information Services webpage.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Step 1: Go to <a href="http://www.metrostate.edu/">www.metrostate.edu</a></li>
  <li>Step 2:  Click CURRENT STUDENTS on the header</li>
  <li>Step 3:  Select the LEARN MORE button in the blue “Learning Resources” box</li>
  <li>Step 4: Click on the LIBRARY AND INFORMATION SERVICES button by scrolling down to the third option on the “Learning Resources” page</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also go directly to www.metrostate.edu/student/learning-resources/learning-resources/library-and-information-services. This one-stop webpage will help you locate a library service that fits your needs. You can use this site to contact a librarian or use “One Search” to find your material. My favorite feature is the “LIBRARY HOURS TODAY” link above the “One Search” box. If you ever wondered when the library is open, this will help you plan your day. The Metro State Library is open more hours than a traditional library, giving you plenty of time to finish your work.</p>

<p>Good luck in the final weeks of the semester. The Metro State Library is a great resource to help you achieve your academic goals. I hope you use it.</p>
