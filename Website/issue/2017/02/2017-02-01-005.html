<p>When it comes to the activities of Metro State students, and the dollars needed, virtually all funding flows through the pocketbook of the Student Activity Fees Allocation Committee (SAFAC).</p>
<p>SAFAC is one of seven subcommittees of Student Senate. “It’s a little different than the other subcommittees, as they have their own set of governing bylaws,” said Dhibo Hussein, president of Student Senate. “SAFAC answers to Senate, but they are in charge of all financial decisions when it comes to such things as student activity fees, club funds and budgets. SAFAC makes the decisions and then recommends them to the Senate where it gets voted on.”</p>
<p>Before the Student Senate meetings (held twice a month), SAFAC will hold their own meeting to decide on funding requests to be brought before the Senate for voting. If a request is denied by SAFAC, the students or organizations have a right to appeal and lobby before the Senate for approval.</p>
<p>SAFAC is allowed to approve any allocation requests up to $3000, but any requests over that amount are brought directly to the Senate. Any disagreements between SAFAC and the Senate are debated by the Senate’s executive committee and SAFAC’s chairperson (currently Kelly Condon), where it’s decided whether the funding request will be brought before the Senate for voting.</p>
<p>In other Senate developments, one was regarding the bi-monthly Senate meetings—which are presently held at the Dayton’s Bluff Campus. Hussein mentioned that they working toward having the other Metro State locations host some of the future Senate meetings. According to Hussein, this idea was ”partly brought forth by the student body and also by senators to see if we could maximize our outreach to make sure all the other campuses feel included in our decisions.”</p>
<p>Wanting to raise awareness about serving on the Senate or other organizations, Hussein says, “Part of our job is to make sure that students get the opportunity or at least are aware that they are able to serve on these committees, whether it is the Senate committee or a university committee or even a Minnesota State committee.” Interested students can contact Student Senate. Their information (as well as various clubs and organizations at Metro State) is available at OrgSync on the school’s website. Or, Hussein can be emailed directly at wv5002oi@metrostate.edu for more details.</p>
<p>Regarding Minnesota State committees, one new and interesting development is Transfer Pathways. A few years back, Hussein explains, some students brought forth the fact that the transfer of credits from one Minnesota post-secondary school to another (a two-year to four-year college, for example) was not always an easy process.</p>
<p>So MnSCU (Minnesota State Colleges and Universities) stepped in and created the Transfer Pathways program as a state-wide initiative. The program works on “simplifying the curriculum and allowing for a smoother transition,” says Hussein. “It’s common where students have to spend a lot of time making up certain credits for classes because it doesn’t necessarily transfer properly, so this initiative is to make sure that all these courses transfer as best as possible into four-year majors,” she adds.</p>
<p>Ideally, the various groups (depending on type of degree or major) are made up of students who have gone through the transfer process. These students are instrumental in shedding light on possible pitfalls and how to improve the system’s methods in order to smooth out the transition for future students. According to Hussein, there are 14 Transfer Pathways committees—representing various majors—meeting this spring semester.</p>
<p>The first committees were formed during last fall’s semester, so the program is still in its early stages. It seems to have the potential of being highly beneficial to students throughout the state, and also at Metro State.</p>
