<p>In talking with students all over campus, I’ve found that many aren’t aware of the various discounted and free services available to anyone with an “.edu” email address. Due to my major and eventual career path, I’m more aware of the services available to those pursuing degrees in Computer Science, Computer Information Technology, Management of Information Systems, and so on. But there are also more universal products like Amazon Prime and The New York Times that have discounts available to .edu email holders.</p>


<h2><a href="http://amazon.com/gp/student/signup/info/">Amazon Student Prime</a></h2>
<p>Most people are aware of Amazon Prime, a subscription-based package of Amazon Prime video streaming, photo storage and, of course, two-day delivery. However, what many don’t know is that students can get all of Amazon Prime’s benefits for 50 percent off and, in fact, can get their first six months of Prime for free right now, thanks to a promotional offer.</p>


<h2><a href="http://newegg.com/students">NewEgg Premier</a></h2>
<p>NewEgg, the predominant online computer part emporium, also offers a discount for its premier (two-day shipping) service. Those with an .edu email address will pay only $29.99/yr. instead of the usual $49.99/yr. Existing Premier subscribers can even connect their .edu email address and receive an immediate $20 refund.</p>


<h2><a href="http://nytimes.com/college">The New York Times</a></h2>
<p>The New York Times is arguably the most significant provider of news in the country, but getting a copy comes at a cost: $15/mo for a digital subscription, or $80/mo for Monday-Sunday paper delivery.</p>
<p>With an .edu email address, a digital subscription is just $4/mo, and all physical delivery options are 50 percent off.</p>


<h2><a href="http://imagine.microsoft.com">Microsoft Imagine</a></h2>
<p>Microsoft Imagine used to be known as Dreamspark. I can’t say I know why they rebranded, but all Metropolitan State students have access to the full Imagine catalog. Simply go to imagine.microsoft.com, sign in to your normal Microsoft (live.com) account, and you’ll be able to connect and verify your metrostate.edu email address.</p>

<p>Once connected, you’ll be able to access a number of useful, and normally quite costly tools, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>An extended 3-month trial for Parallels Desktop for Mac Pro Edition, which allows you to run Windows applications on Macintosh computers. (The normal trial is only 14 days!)</li>
  <li>Windows Server 2016, the server variant of desktop Windows. This can be used in place of the more privacy-invasive Windows 10, and I use it on my personal desktop computer.</li>
  <li>SQL Server 2016 Enterprise, Microsoft’s enterprise database solution.</li>
  <li>The Microsoft R Server, an industry standard programming language for advanced statistical analysis.</li>
</ul>


<h2><a href="http://jetbrains.com/student">JetBrains Student Account</a></h2>
<p>Alas, this one is relevant only to students learning application development of some nature, yet I feel it is utterly essential to them. Most such majors should be familiar with the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) which makes it easier to write, debug and parse complex computer programs. There are, in my semi-professional opinion, only two good IDEs on the market: Microsoft’s Visual Studio and JetBrains. (Eclipse and NetBeans -- the two programs most commonly taught in Metro’s courses -- are both severely lacking.)</p>

<p>Visual Studio has a free community edition, but mostly, it only works with Microsoft’s own programming languages. JetBrains works with PHP, Java and many others, but is quite expensive. Unless, that is, you sign up with your student email account, at which point you can get their development suites for free.</p>

<p>Plus, once you obtain a JetBrains student license, you will also be eligible for a 25 percent graduation discount towards a personal license.</p>
