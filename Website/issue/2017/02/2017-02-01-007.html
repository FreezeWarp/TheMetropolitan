<p>In collaboration with Minneapolis Community and Technical College’s Theater on the Park, Metro State’s Theater Underground will be presenting the musical “Urinetown” for the spring semester production. Directed by Justin Kirkberg, the Tony Award-winning play by Mark Hollmann and Greg Kotis circles around a town where a 20-year drought has led to a government ban on toilets—leading to the privatization of the toilets.</p>
<p>“Urinetown is an irreverent take on what is quickly becoming our national reality,” said director Justin Kirkeberg, “where the line between the government and corporate America is blurred—almost to the point of non-existence."</p>
<p>Street Parking is available, but ramp parking is also available for $5, or free for any Metro State student with a college ID card. Please visit Theater Underground’s Orgsync page for more information. Advisor Gail Smogard is available for any additional information at <a href="mailto:gail.smogard@metrostate.edu">gail.smogard@metrostate.edu</a>. Students and Families may attend with no cost, but are encouraged to bring an item to donate to the food shelf.</p>
<p>Persons with disabilities who would like accommodations to participate in the event should contact the Center for Accessibility Resources at <a href="tel:6517931549">651-793-1549.</a></p>
