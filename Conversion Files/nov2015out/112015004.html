<p>After 30 years as an instructor at Macalester College, Peter Rachleff retired from teaching. But he didn't want to retire from making a difference in his community. As a labor historian, Rachleff believed that the East Side Freedom Library (ESFL) in Saint Paul’s Payne-Phalen neighborhood was a natural place to invest his efforts.</p>
<p>The difference between the ESFL and most other libraries is the focus; all books in the collection are related to important issues such as labor, immigration, race and social justice. Although the topics are limited, all genres will be accepted including nonfiction, poetry, fiction, plays and memoirs.</p>
<p>The library is housed in what was the Arlington Hills Branch of the Saint Paul Public Library system, an appropriate location since the area itself illustrates the ups and downs of working-class neighborhoods.</p>
<p>About 15,000 unionized jobs disappeared when businesses including Hamm’s Brewery, American Hoist and Derrick, Whirlpool and 3M left Dayton’s Bluff in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The neighborhood changed as many residents moved away and those left behind felt abandoned and bitter, Rachleff said.</p>
<p>The library’s collection, which Rachleff estimates will total 15,000 non-circulating volumes, will include a good dose of local flavor and encompass critical points in labor history. The ESFL will also house the Hmong Archives, a 20-year-old collection that contains musical instruments, videos and story cloths, visual documents created by Hmong women to tell their community’s history.</p>
<p>The library is also expecting another important gift, a batch of feminist literature . “Women play critical roles in working-class life,” Rachleff said. “Class relations and identities are gendered — both masculinity and femininity are shaped in terms of labor. Feminism provides us with the theoretical and analytical tools that can help us understand these dimensions of the working-class experiences.”</p>
<p>Volunteers and interns are continuing to catalog the donated materials, which they’ve been amassing since the first of the year. About half of the 12,000 books so far, are from Rachleff himself. Rachleff thinks the library could hold about 15,000 books.</p>
<p>Although the library has yet to open for daily visitors, the ESFL has already been making a difference by hosting events, films and forums. The October events alone included a family-friendly play “Stripe and Spot (Learn to) Get Along”; a discussion with Floyd Williams, author of “The Origins of Racism” and “The Holy Black Papyrus”; a school-board candidate meet and greet; and a conversation with film actor Roger Guenveur Smith, who was in town to perform his one-man show “Rodney King” at the Penumbra Theatre.</p>
<p>The space is also being used during the day for educational programming and community outreach. Recent educational events included Rachleff’s six-week course on how to tell the story of labor through art and music, and a journalism workshop by Allison Herrera of the Twin Cities Daily Planet.</p>
<p>The ESFL performance space also serves as a community resource. A group of Karen women — the Karen are an ethnic group from Myanmar — have held regular weaving sessions in the basement since Rachleff met them while teaching at the Roseville Adult Learning Center. Rachleff noticed issues of isolation and depression among the women and offered the library space. The activity helps to alleviate both problems, and the women are now making a profit by selling the clothes that they weave during the sessions.</p>
<p>The downstairs space will also be used as a performance space after it is renovated. A wooden sprung floor will replace the current harder surface and will make it suitable for performances and yoga classes.</p>
<p>Rachleff hopes to open up the East Side Freedom Library at the beginning of 2016.</p>
