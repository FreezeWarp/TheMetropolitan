<p>On a Thursday afternoon, Metro student Jennifer Lopez walked into Room 12 at the Midway Center looking for help. Lopez, who is a Psychology major, works at the Humane Society and wanted to create a short film to advertise the organization's animal rescue efforts.</p>

<p>A few minutes after Lopez arrived, the doors burst open and two young men entered, weighed down with camera equipment. Andrew Mueller and Ian Withey belong to the Metropolitan State University Film Club. Mueller, the group’s leader, had brought Cliff Bars for everyone to snack on during the meeting. The two of them greeted Lopez and put down their bags and Cliff Bars.</p>

<p>Mueller sat down next to Lopez and began poring over Lopez's oversized sketchbook, where she kept ideas and storyboards for the project. The plan was to start the video with a point-of-view shot of a stray cat on the street and then end with footage of the cat happy and playful after adoption. Mueller and Withey began to discuss methods for getting video from a cat's perspective and whether they should tape whiskers to the camera.</p>

<p>To get a realistic take on the situation, Mueller got down on all fours and began to crawl around the room meowing. Then he stood up, grabbed a camera and leaned over to take video from the floor. He walked the camera around the room and then quickly brought the camera up onto a chair to simulate a jumping cat.</p>

<p>As Mueller and Lopez reviewed the footage, more Film Club members arrived. Each new arrival had an idea for how to get the shot. One member suggested attaching the camera to a tripod and holding it upside down. Another wanted to build a short cart and suspend the camera from rubber bands. Someone else suggested just tying a camera to a cat. This was quickly voted down, as it was deemed inhumane.</p>

<p>Withey pointed out that Sam Raimi had used a camera tied between two parallel boards to achieve a similar effect in the “Evil Dead” movies. He then pulled up footage from one of the movie and projected it on the main screen. Then, just for good measure, he also showed the group his favorite scene from the second movie. At this point, there were six people in the room, all of them discussing the plot to “The Evil Dead.”</p>

<p>Earlier, Withey had used the projector to show the group a tracking shot that had been captured with a jib, a long tripod that can create smooth sweeping camera movements. The club had just received additional funding from Student Senate and members were excited to purchase new equipment such as jibs, dollies and lights.</p>

<p>Not all of the group's equipment is store-bought, however. One of Mueller's favorite piece of filming equipment is one he built himself for only $40. “On YouTube I found a tutorial to build this slider that is made out of PVC and you attach your tripod into the PVC. It slides with rollerblade wheels across the PVC, so you get those good sliding motion shots,” he said. “It works really good, like surprisingly good for being a piece of PVC pipe. But I really like that. It gives it a nice little movement and makes your shots more interesting.”</p>

<p>The club has a very D.I.Y. appeal to it. The members are willing to learn about and pitch in on every aspect of a project. According to Mueller, “I guess my feel for what we're about is a pseudo film school. So you'll learn how to set up lights, cinematography, editing, anything that goes into it.” Mueller also enjoys working with special effects, “Oh yeah, that's something that I really like to do, just practicing special effects and motion graphics and compositing. That's also something that's available if anyone wants to learn that. I would love to have that if someone was really into that, because you learn though teaching.”</p>

<p>Withey has a similar perspective. Early in October, the club participated in the 48 Hour Film Horror Project, a contest in which teams had 48 hours to write, film and edit a short horror movie. “All of us were shooting, directing, all that. We were also all acting in it, so we had many hats in that one,” said Withey.</p>

<p>Withey was happy with the results. “I think it turned out pretty good,” he said. “We had a lot of really unique shots. … We got lucky and we were able to use a local comic book shop, Level Up Games in South Saint Paul. They let us shoot there, so we got some production value just by using a location like that.”</p>

<p>The Film Club posts most of their current projects on their OrgSync page, and their entry into the 48 Hour Project is available now. OrgSync is also where students can go if they want to join the Film Club. “It says on our OrgSync Thursdays from 2 p.m. to 5:30. If you don't get out of class until 3:30, that's fine, come on by,” said Mueller.</p>

<p>As Withey says, Film Club isn't just for screenwriting majors or aspiring directors.</p>

<p>It's for everyone. ... Even if you don't want to direct anything, it will give you a different appreciation of film in general, movies, TV, everything. So then you'll watch a TV show and you'll see a shot and you'll be like “Oh, they probably did this or this.” Or you'll start looking for edits in movies where you'll see where they cut. But it's really for anyone who likes to have a creative outlet.</p>
