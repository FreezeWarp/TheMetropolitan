<p>Although many pursue a psychology degree for a chance to study diverse topics, students mainly select this major for an opportunity to help other people. Future psychologists typically have an innate desire to assist and provide relief to those that need guidance. In a world that can be negative and dark, these individuals see the world more optimistically. They like to see people for their positive attributes and their potential for growth. They also enjoy working with people from all walks of life, including children, teens and the elderly.</p>

<p>Luckily, psychology students (major or non-major) do not have to face challenges alone. Whether they are seeking graduate school or trying to do well on the next exam, students can find assistance with their friends at the Psych Club. The Psych Club is connected to helpful faculty and students. They have an interest in seeing students succeed this semester and beyond. Students that are Psych Club members have the “training partners” they need to help them stay on course. The Psych Club also has many programs that supplement classroom learning.</p>

<p>Before finding work where they can make a difference in someone’s life, future psychologists must complete rigorous training. Sometimes a bachelor’s degree is all they need to secure a job in their chosen occupation. Many, however, realize a need to obtain a graduate degree. A graduate degree in psychology will help open the door to more opportunities in this field. Admittance to graduate school is a very challenging endeavor, though. Students seeking entry to a program will experience competitiveness. Admission representatives critically analyze student grades and GRE (Admission Test) scores. They also assess an applicant’s commitment and ambition through written statements and interviews. These guidelines can overwhelm students.</p>

<p>As a student, there are times when studying alone can be distracting. There are also occasions when the course content can be confusing. The Psych Club holds group study sessions throughout the semester to help students with their homework. On select Mondays, students of the Psych Club will meet from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m., with these sessions alternating between Midway Center and the Dayton’s Bluff campus. There are also weekend study sessions from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. in the campus library at Dayton’s Bluff. These meetings give students an opportunity to ask questions.</p>

<p>Besides studying for exams, the Psych Club works together on writing skills. Their tips help students prepare for their next paper. Occasionally, there are workshops to go over specific writing techniques, including those used in scientific writing. These unique programs will help students learn how to write scientific manuscripts in APA style. They will receive information on referencing their resources and using concise words. Psych Club leaders will also review the use of PsychINFO (an informational database) to find material for a research paper.</p>

<p>In October, the Psych Club will host two special events as part of a Graduate School Informational Night series. The first event will take place Oct. 6, in NM L213, on the Saint Paul Campus. This program will start at 4 p.m. and end at 6 p.m. Representatives from area colleges will discuss their graduate programs. Bethel University, St. Mary’s University and the Adler School of Psychology will provide information on admissions processes. The second event will occur Oct. 27, in NM L213, on the Saint Paul Campus. This program will start at 4 p.m. and end at 6 p.m. An admissions counselor from our school will discuss graduate programs available at Metropolitan State University. They will also explain the application process, including fees, letters of recommendation and personal statements. They will also describe how students can prepare for the GRE examination and pay for graduate school tuition and fees.</p>
