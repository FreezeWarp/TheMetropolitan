<p>This is the time of year when the temperature drops and so do immune systems. The change in weather means a few things, and the one I hate most is cold and flu season. During this time of year extra caution should be taken to avoid public nose pickers, and take a little extra care of yourselves.</p>
<p>I’m a germaphobe to the extreme. However, it isn’t out of ignorance. Growing up I had horrible asthma. The year round wheeze that made colds deadly. I would miss weeks of school when a simple head cold would turn into bronchitis and then some times pneumonia. I thought that was all in the past until three years ago. It started with a simple cold, and then went to my lungs. That cold turned into bronchitis.</p>
<p>Luckily, I was attending Minneapolis Community and Technical College at the time, and the student clinic just opened. I was able to get free health care and affordable medication to treat my illness. My husband then boyfriend cared for me and unfortunately came down with the same illness. Both of us missed work (losing wages), and missed classes (falling behind on school work). Being sick as an adult sucks even more than as a kid.</p>
<p>So, try your best to avoid getting sick with these tips:</p>
<p>Don’t push a door when it says pull. What I mean to say is pay attention to what you are touching. How many times do we open a door and then touch our faces or eat. Just be aware.</p>
<p>Respect your body. As the weather gets colder immune systems weaken. I’m not saying to totally slack off. However, if you are feeling tired. Listen to your body, take naps, take in extra vitamins. Give yourself time to unwind at the end of the day. Stress can wreak havoc on your body.</p>
<p>Carry a small bottle of hand sanitizer. At the main campus hand sanitizer is plentiful and spread all over. However, for some reason at midway campus I could not find one sanitizer dispenser. Spend a couple bucks for the added safety.</p>
<p>Treat yo-self. Not to anything fun, but to something important: a flu shot. This is important for students with weaker immune systems.</p>
<p>Are you reading this and cursing because you are already sick? Here is a list of self-care tips to help you get through the flu and colds.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Drink tons of fluids. The clearer the better! My mother (a nurse practitioner) always told us how important it is to replace liquids lost from fever and respiratory evaporation. Clear fluids will also help loosen up mucus.</li>
  <li>Stock up on or make soup. I live on a shoe-string budget, so I make vegetable and bone broth from food scraps and freeze it. It is cheaper than buying it at the store. If you are short on time and money check out Metro’s food shelf. They have healthy options to nourish you whether you are healthy or sick.</li>
  <li>Stay home! No one wants your germs; moreover, it isn’t wise to stress out your body and mind during illness. The only time I’ll ever say miss a class is if you are sick. Please stay home, because I don’t want you making others ill.</li>
  <li>Respect those around you and wash your hands! No one likes the local classroom nose picker, especially when they have a cold. Beware of what you are touching and if you blow your nose (or pick it) please WASH YOUR HANDS! This helps reduce the spread of germs and protects people with weakened immune systems.</li>
