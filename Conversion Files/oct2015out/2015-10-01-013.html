<p>Halloween can be a very innocent holiday. Kids in pumpkin costumes meander across the neighborhood, friends reconnect over firelight and cider. But, there’s no need to sugar-coat Halloween with such a shiny veneer; it’s a time for debauchery, a time to embrace the dark corners of this strange human existence.</p>
<p>Consider this list a catalyst for your Halloween excursions. It should help you embrace this grotesque holiday and all it offers.</p>


<h2>Drink (but don’t drive or die. That’s too weird)</h2>
<p>There is a direct correlation between strange Halloween experiences and alcohol consumption. If you plan on a low-key Halloween, think small sips and plenty of ice. However, if you prefer to forget your most memorable holidays, consider the following advice.</p>
<p>Since Halloween is on a Saturday this year, that gives you plenty of opportunities to get at the bottle. Take a mental note: you can’t drink all day if you don’t start in the morning. I advise you to start your day with an in-shower Screwdriver. Then, switch to beer for a while. That case of low-quality domestic brew in your fridge isn’t going to drink itself. Can’t you hear them calling you from the bottom shelf like a choir of angels? On second thought, if your beer starts singing to you, maybe switch to water for a bit.</p>


<h2>Don’t limit your child’s candy consumption</h2>
<p>What kind of buzzkill would tell their kid they’re only allowed a couple candy bars on Halloween? Let your kid go wild- this is a perfect time to teach them about self-control. It’s also a perfect time to try to clean vomit out of Auntie’s new polar bear rug. Worry about your kid’s blood sugar later, today is a day for excess.</p>


<h2>Prank Trick-or-Treaters</h2>
<p>Where do these kids get the guff to show up at your door begging for candy? Can they not read the “no solicitors” sign you hung on the door last year? It’s time for you to take action. Break out the fetish gear and the chainsaws. Pretend you’re a scarecrow. Get creative- you only get one chance a year to mess with kids and not get arrested.</p>
<p>Here’s two strategies that have worked well for me in the past:</p>
<p>Reverse trick-or-treating: How does it work? Tie a trip line at the far edges of your front lawn. Strong twine and metal tent stakes work well. When the kids try to walk to the front door, they trip on your twine and spill their candy in the yard. Those little buggers will try to pick it up, but they never get it all. In the morning, you can pick up the leftovers and keep them for yourself.</p>
<p>Pretend it’s Christmas: Regardless of which faith you profess, a fake Christmas is sure to confuse the neighborhood. Decorate your front yard with plastic trees and lights. Instead of the usual candy, bake a ham and smash some potatoes. Then when kids come to the door, drop a plate of food into their bag. Or, dress like Santa, tell everyone they’re on the naughty list, and give them all a piece of charcoal.</p>
<p>I hope these tips inspire you to keep Halloween grimy. However you decide to spend your day, it ought to be as weird as it is fun.</p>
