<p>For over 20 years, a building sat vacant on East Lake Street in Minneapolis. After many years of business, this awesome feat of construction closed its doors in 1994. It was an active site that contained the renowned Sears, Roebuck, and Company Warehouse and Store. A property known as a beacon of opportunity was now desolate and abandoned.</p>
<p>Today, with the help of many supporters, the building is open and ready for business! In 2006, the Midtown Global Market became tenants of this historical location. This unique market includes several small businesses that have brought energy and new life to this area. These establishments have great satisfaction in serving their communities and bringing customers excellent products and services.</p>
<p>If you have never visited the Midtown Global Market, I recommend that you check it out soon. It is a fun place to visit and behold something new. For me, the Midtown Global Market experience reminded me of my time going to the Minnesota State Fair—without the added entrance fee. This Market has an abundance of food choices and many things to notice.</p>

<h2>Food</h2>
<p>If you are tired of the same old foods, the Market will have many food varieties to satisfy your “adventurous appetite.” There are tasty foods with from a diversity of ethnic cuisines, including Middle Eastern, Korean, Moroccan and Cambodian.

For instance, Fresco’s Pasta Bar has a great salad selection. If you love breakfast, La Loma, known for their tamales, has an all-day breakfast menu. There are also many value meal options. Los Ocampo, for instance, has daily specials for the weekdays.</p>

Restaurants, such as Manny’s Tortas, had articles in well-known publications including the Star Tribune and the Best of the Twin Cities.</p>
