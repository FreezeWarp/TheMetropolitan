<p>Metropolitan State offers classes that work with many non-profit organizations in the Twin Cities. These classes have organized projects within the curriculum that give students real-world experiences. In some cases, students not only get a grade from finishing the project, but also receive an inspirational and gratifying experience. These experiences are something one can’t teach through a book. This is what makes these type of classes so special, along with our school.</p>
<p>At any point in time you might have seen brightly wrapped boxes and flyers around school asking for generous donations. These could include an array of suggestions, dependent on the charity our students are working with. Recently, Metro State students Alora Deplacito and Katrina Clynch had a project from their child development class. This class had them work with a non-profit pertaining to children. The charity they chose was Chase’s Toy Chest, a children’s charity that is committed to providing toys for the holidays at local hospitals for sick children and their siblings. This is a charity that Clynch has close ties with. She knows the founders of this charity and, for health reasons, she also spent many months as an infant in the hospital. For the duration of the drive, Clynch and Deplacito received 38 items for a range of children; from infant to older teen. They both found the experience to be fun and heartwarming.</p>
<p>Clynch and Deplacito where inspired to do the toy drive by a food drive, put forth by a non-profit called “Show Away Hunger,” which provides food to hungry college students and over 200 individuals. This non-profit focuses on three main goals to influence what they do: changing the perception, environment, and lives. There are also other non-profit companies Metro State collaborates with. One is East Side Enterprise Center (ESEC), a business that works as a coalition for many small companies in East St. Paul. ESEC aids in building support, resources, advocacy, cultural sensitivity and respect in the multi-cultural communities. They hope to achieve support for new businesses and establish increasing growth in East St. Paul. Another is Voices for Racial Justice (VRJ), which has been around since 1993. They want to advance racial, cultural, social and economic justice in Minnesota. They use the Organizing Apprenticeship Project and visionary steps to create a more inclusive and equitable state.</p>
