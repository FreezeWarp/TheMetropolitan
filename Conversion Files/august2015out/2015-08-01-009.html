<p>“I can’t get on the Wi-Fi.” How many times have I heard that phrase? Just about every day in class, often in the library, and practically hourly at the help desk. To hear people tell it, you’d think our network was an unstable relic.</p>
<p>Working in the ITS department, I’m part of the team who that has to write, edit, and test the Wi-Fi guides.  for Mac, Windows, iPhone, and Android, all of which are available online at www.metrostate.edu/wireless or in print at the ITS front desk and the LibraryMetropolitan State University Library. Long hours of troubleshooting have taught me that most students are just making one of the following mistakes:</p>
<p>1. You’re probably on the wrong network. Metro students should be using “Metrostate.” Why? Well, “StarLAN” will kick you off after four hours; , yet “Metrostate” won’t log you out until you have to change your StarID password (every 6 months). “StarLAN” is designed so students visiting from other MnSCU schools can use their StarIDs to get online. Consider it a backup option.</p>
<p>2. Double-check those checkboxes. You followed the guide, and it worked the first time, but coming back to campus later you’re offline again. You probably missed a checkbox. This is most common on Windows laptops, but it’s a problem for every device. Easy to fix!</p>
<p>3. Don’t sit in a dead zone. One of my favorite study spots is a small alcove in the basement of Founders Hall, near The Metropolitan office. Unfortunately, it happens to be a Wi-Fi dead zone. There are routers all over campus, but they can’t reach everywhere. If your connection drops in a particular spot, seek out a better one.</p>
<p>4. When in doubt, wipe it out. Don’t hesitate to click “Forget this network.” ,” Grab grab the guide and start from the top, b. Because sometimes, you just need a hard reset.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, Metro has a huge network used by thousands of students and faculty across four campuses. You want to get online; we want things to run smoothly. Give these tips a shot next time you have net trouble, and if they don’t work, get in touch with ITS via phone (651-793-1240), email (IT.Desk@metrostate.edu), or in person at New Main L105. We’ll take a look.</p>
