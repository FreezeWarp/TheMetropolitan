<p>From its beginning, Metropolitan State has had a unique educational style, with its utilization of community classrooms and faculty. With classes spread across the metro area, at times, this can present logistical challenges. But even if one masters the highways, maneuvering the hallways, floors—and tunnels—can be tricky as well (it was quite some time before I knew even where the old cafeteria was located).</p>
<p>Having attended Metro State a few years now, I still remember my first day, and class, at the Dayton’s Bluff Campus. After parking in the lot (now the new parking ramp), I meandered my way through St. John’s halls to the library skyway. I then took the stairs to the library’s 3rd floor, working my way down another hallway to the back corner room for my Mathematics of Sustainability class. It turned out to be a sweet spot, with a view of downtown St. Paul and planes flying in to the airport, but getting there took some twists and turns.</p>
<p>Although I’ve attended several classes at Midway Center, I still get tripped up, with hallways that either dead-end or appear in unexpected places. I once walked twice around the perimeter. On the first lap my classroom was right where I left it; the second—I walked right by it, and would’ve kept going if my walk mate hadn’t stopped. Maybe it’s the hallway’s triangular outlay. Maybe it’s just my knack for getting turned around at times when I’m indoors. (I don’t know if I’m alone in this; perhaps I should carry a compass to class.)</p>
<p>The locations at Minneapolis and Brooklyn Park’s Law Enforcement Center’s present challenges as well, either indoors or out—partly to do with their sharing of space with Minneapolis Community and Technical College and Hennepin Technical College. Fortunately, Metro State’s website provides outdoor maps to the four main Metro locations, and also to the numerous other sites around the Twin Cities.</p>
<p>And, floorplan maps are also available—in PDF format—for some of the main campuses; thanks to the creative, extra-mile effort of tracking them down by Phil Fuehrer, interim director of student development and programming.</p>
<p>Just asking someone for directions is another great option, with many people available—and more than willing—to help out. Here’s to everyone’s success in their classes, whatever they may be. And here’s to success in finding those classes, wherever they may be.</p>
