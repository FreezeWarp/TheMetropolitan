<p>The Goat Coffeehouse, formerly known as the Dancing Goat, is largely immersed in its cultural surroundings. Walking distance from Metropolitan State University, this young business was established August of 2014 and, according to co-owner Ben Hosfield, resides in the old sheriff building off of 7th Street. They get their name from an Ethiopian legend about a goat herder who accidentally discovered a coffee plant. This appeals to many serious coffee drinkers, as it is a story about how coffee came about.</p>
<p>The story is painted on the wall behind the register and has been part of the inspiration for the business. As you walk in the door the ambiance exudes the essence of East St. Paul, a concept the owners, including Hosfield, put much thought into. Great seating includes a delightful patio and high-top cafe tables on the ground floor, while the upstairs boasts wingback chairs, sofas and end tables; this provides many types of studying situations for students.</p>
<p>Great atmosphere is just one of the countless features this local, independent coffeehouse has to offer Metro State students. They specialize in espresso and coffee drinks served hot, blended, or iced, along with teas and fruit smoothies. Their menu also includes breakfast and lunch with fresh ingredients and affordable prices. Metro students get 10 percent off with their Metro ID.</p>
<p>The coffeehouse has recently created a free app for both android and iPhone users. The app includes many useful categories, including ordering ahead and a loyalty stamp card. The app is user-friendly and makes it easy for the customer to pre-order before commuting. Orders are easily customizable and prices are clearly shown so the total is not a surprises when checking out. When to pick up is shown next to the breakdown of the order. For each order the user can receive a stamp; when the user collects 10 stamps they unlock a free drink. This app is great for students before or in between classes.</p>
<p>The Goat Coffeehouse is open until 7 p.m. Monday through Saturday and until 6 p.m. on Sunday. Late hours make it more accessible for students to get great coffee before a late class. In between classes students should check out one of the many activities going on at the coffeehouse. Coffee and Canvas is a painting event that is available for customers to preorder tickets so they can paint and drink coffee. Other events this month include a visit from an egg roll food truck in the parking lot every Friday. The Goat is always looking for new ways to involve the community by hosting a different event every month.</p>
<p>This way of thinking has the owners always looking to the future. The store has made it a priority to have sustainable choices within the company; including recyclable to-go cups a green aspect to the company that they are proud of.  Eventually they want to expand by adding a garden on the roof so that they can grow their own produce for the culinary portion of the menu. Other ideas include serving wine and beer following later hours.</p>
<p>This quaint coffee shop is a great place to start when experiencing the community that surrounds the Metro State Campus. The appeal of this charming shop is worth checking out. A peaceful environment creates a great place for studying, enjoying a great cup of coffee, and a bite to eat.</p>
