<p>Would you like a FREE steak dinner? Would it be fun to win gift cards and other fabulous prizes? Do you enjoy complimentary coffee and cookies? How does a no-cost canoe trip appeal to you? What are your thoughts about concerts with no charge? Do these giveaways sound too good to be true?  Well, in this case, they are realities.</p>
<p>During the school year, Metropolitan State University holds special events for their students. These gatherings provide many benefits beyond the freebies and fun. As a Metro State student, you have an opportunity for experiences beyond the classroom. Attending a university event is an excellent way to supplement your learning. You can also join a student organization to enhance your skills.</p>
<p>When you participate in extracurricular activities, there is a chance to grow. Many students connect through networking, meeting new people, and going to discussions, where they discover useful information. They also increase their exposure to real-world possibilities. Students are often exposed to projects where they apply concepts from their studies, and can also find fulfillment through volunteering and community involvement. These are all potentials for you when getting involved in student happenings.</p>
<p>As a new or existing student, you may not know of options that are available to you. Sometimes these opportunities are well-communicated but remain undiscovered due to the clutter of information that exists. Unless someone directs your attention personally, you may miss your chance to do something interesting. To avoid this occurrence, you could proactively seek out these magnificent opportunities.</p>
<p>If you are on the main campus, take the time to look at the postings—on a big bulletin board—in the library entryway. This board is a go-to spot for up-to-date flyers. You can also find notifications in the hallway between the library’s first-floor computer lab and the bookstore.</p>
<p>If you cannot visit the main campus, information is available online. Many notices should come to you by your school email. Besides checking your inbox, I recommend checking the clutter folder; you might receive these emails there.</p>
<p>Or, you could visit Metro State’s OrgSync website. OrgSync may be new to you. It was to me. This resource can help you locate student activities and organizations. This page will help you determine times and dates for upcoming events—along with a brief description of each event. Plus, you will find details on how to register.</p>
<p>If you are looking to add student organization participation to your student resume, Orgsync will help you discover a group to join. There are 56 groups, including the Accounting Club and the Writer’s Think Tank, currently listed. Each group has their designated portal within Metro State’s Orgsync. A group profile page specifies goals and contact information; you can also use the group’s portal to view their previous events. Besides accessing this Orgsync site for these student organizations, you can also use their bookmark to find student job postings, including internship information.</p>
<p>To access the Metro State OrgSync page, you need to complete these steps:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Go to the <a href="http://www.metrostate.edu/">Metropolitan State University website</a>.</li>
  <li>Find the top menu bar and select the CURRENT STUDENTS tab</li>
  <li>Locate the secondary menu bar to the right of the Metropolitan State University logo and select Student Life</li>
  <li>Find the blue sidebar menu to the left and select the OrgSync tab</li>
  <li>Start your user account by providing a name and email address. You will also need to create a password and agree to user terms</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you have completed these steps, you’re in. You will be an official member of Metro State’s OrgSync! You are on your way to getting involved and realizing remarkable experiences, and will no longer have to wonder if there is something that you are missing.</p>
