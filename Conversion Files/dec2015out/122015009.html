<p>Talk has been circulating on campus that Metropolitan State University might soon be getting its own mascot. I've become so excited about the possibilities that I went ahead and created a few candidates on my own. I would like to offer these suggestions to the college’s public relations department. What could be better than a mascot that truly reflects the culture and population of the school?</p>


<p><strong>The Metro State Scholars:</strong></p>
<p>We should highlight the fact that Metro is the only MnSCU school not to have a sports program. When Saint Cloud State’s hockey jocks swing by to give our nerd mascot a wedgie, that’ll just be unfortunate.</p>


<p><strong>The Metro State Dancing Goat:</strong></p>
<p>Submitted for your approval, either a man in a goat costume or a trained dancing goat. Your move, Admins.</p>


<p><strong>The Metro State Swede Hollow:</strong></p>
<p>It’ll be awesome! Picture it: we’ll be a giant community based on one of the highest bluffs in the entire state of Minnesota! Nothing will be more reassuring or intimidating!</p>
<p>Well, except, you know, a commuter light rail line. That might do it.</p>


<p><strong>The Metro State Tuition Freezes:</strong></p>
<p>Yeah! It’ll be perfect. Well, it’ll be awkward. But, it’ll be perfectly awkward! It would just be somebody completely painted blue on the front, clothed in winter gear. But their back isn’t painted at all. It's almost like the tuition ended up thawing. Whoops.</p>


<p><strong>The Metro State Adjunct Professors:</strong></p>
<p>I should warn anybody who wants to go with this option: it’s really quick and convenient for the school, but whenever a student wants to discuss cheering strategies, the person in the mascot costume already took it off and is nowhere to be found.</p>


<p><strong>The Metro State Seventh Street Brawlers:</strong></p>
<p>Referring back to the Scholars suggestion, fighting simply isn’t in our nature, at least not in any sort aggressive way. So, I propose the “Brawlers.” They are more singers than fighters. Like, “West Side Story” more than “The Outsiders.” Theater Club, can we get you all in on this? C’mon, it’ll be great. Let me know what’s up.</p>


<p><strong>The Metro State East Side Construction Zones:</strong></p>
<p>This one gives just a plethora of possibilities. We could easily highlight any street that is under construction on the beautiful East Side, but I say let’s just go for a prolific mascot. Whoever takes this noble challenge on will be wearing a Highway 52 costume. For some sweet bonus points, we can have a “2011–?” sign around the actor’s burdened shoulders.</p>


<p><strong>The Metro State Saints:</strong></p>
<p>Oh, wait — damn it. That one’s taken already. My bad.</p>


<p><strong>The Metro State Rival Pizza Shops:</strong></p>
<p>This comes with a little bit of a story. In the town where I grew up, we had two Chinese restaurants that were less than two blocks away from each other. The entire time they were seething — staring each other down and praying for my town’s market share. Eventually, they both went out of business within two months of each other. Our mascot could be a recreation of this passive aggressive relationship. All we would need is two individuals and some pizza costumes.</p>


<p><strong>The Metro State MPR Donors:</strong></p>
<p>Oh, how noble, the listener/donor is a major part of the MPR revenue stream. However, it is often possible to see air of smugness wafting off these donors. In the spirit of preventing stereotypes, a design committee will be appointed in order to decide if the wearer of the “I make MPR happen” shirt has Lexus keys in one hand and a Venti coffee in the other, or if they’ll have text books in one and a bus pass in the other.</p>


<p><strong>The Metro State Students Stressing During Finals Week:</strong></p>
<p>The primary benefit of choosing this mascot? It's readily available. Throw a rock during final weeks, and you’ll hit a stressed-out student. As the final days approach, as the importance of passing that class fully dawns in our minds, as those late night study sessions drag on into the early morning, the college will have more and more potential mascots to choose from.</p>


<p>Best of luck during finals week, everyone. Happy New Year.</p>
