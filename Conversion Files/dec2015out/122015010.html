<strong><p>Dr. Kev:</p>
<p>I met a woman, let’s call her Barb, and we clicked right away. When we hung out, it felt like my most fantastic date in months — except it wasn't date. I know for a fact she's actively dating two other guys — a well-heeled businessman whose face looks like a can of boiled meat and an Adonis who is a complete moron. While I've been fine with love triangles before, a rectangle or any other geometric shape just seems like too much. But I want to keep seeing her. What do I do?</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Fourth Wheel</p></strong>

<p>Dear Fourth Wheel,</p>

<p>It seems Cupid is tending bar today, and he’s served you an uncomfortable cocktail: it’s one part friend zone with a half-part sexual frustration, shaken well and served straight in a cloudy glass. Cupid’s a jerk. If I were you, I’d send it back and ask for a shot of something strong. This could get weird.</p>

<p>Let’s start by nipping that F-word in the bud. Either you or Barb are friends or you’re dating, but you can’t be somewhere in between. You also have to ask yourself a question that might be more appropriate coming from a waiter: how many carrots do you like in your soup?</p>


<h2>Love Square</h2>
<p>Before we go any further, you’ve got to make a decision. Are you OK with pursuing and possibly dating someone who has several other partners? This answer needs to be of the “yes” or “no” variety. Be decisive here.</p>

<p>If you’re the jealous type, I’d steer clear of this one. You’re going to be competing for Barb’s attention with at least two other guys. Some dudes can’t handle their girlfriends talking to other guys at the bar, much less them actively seeing other men. If this sounds like you, I’d say you’ve been barking up the wrong tree. Since you said a love square “seems like too much,” I’m guessing you’re leaning this direction.</p>

<p>If that’s the case, you may as well jump ship now and keep looking for Ms. Right. Tear that Band-Aid off before it gets any more difficult. She might become available sometime in the future, and if you had a genuine connection, there’s no reason you couldn’t reconnect later.</p>

<p>That said, maybe you’re OK with Barb seeing other men. There’s nothing wrong with that, as long as you both understand the situation.</p>

<p>The point is this: make up your mind now, before moving forward.</p>


<h2>The F-Bomb</h2>
<p>Barb has dropped that dreaded f-bomb on you: “We’re just friends.” I’ve been there. Her platonic compliments replay in your head throughout the day, and you follow her around saying incomprehensible things hoping she’ll smile. You mumble “I hate your boyfriend,” at the end of every conversation. The friend zone sucks.</p>

<p>If you’ve decided to go head first into this love square, you’ve got to get yourself out of the friend zone and into the polygon.</p>

<p>You’re going to have to make your intentions clear. Tell Barb that you want in on this relationship thing. If you aren’t upfront from the beginning, expect to spend a lot more time wallowing in relationship purgatory.</p>

<p>You may as well ask the question now, rather than wasting your time. Life is short and so is time spent with pretty girls.</p>

<p>If she says yes, then congrats. If not, then move on.</p>


<h2>Or Not</h2>
<p>There is another option — ignore everything I’ve said and stay in the friend zone. You can keep seeing her and accept that you’re not compatible. There will be no awkward dates, no rejection, no fighting for affection and no confusion. Let fat-pocket-meat-face and that beautiful idiot battle it out while you watch from the sidelines. Maybe this isn’t worth fretting over.</p>

<p>In short, make a decision and act on it soon. Hope this helps. Until next time, I remain:</p>

<p>Your Friend,</p>
<p>Dr. Kev</p>
