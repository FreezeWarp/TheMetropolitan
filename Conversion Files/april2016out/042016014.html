<p>Starting this fall, students will be able to complete their English and economics majors at the North Hennepin Community College (NHCC) campus in Brooklyn Park. Communications studies and health systems will be offered in Fall 2017 and psychology will begin in Fall 2018.</p>
<p>This is an expansion of the partnership in which Metropolitan State offers courses on the NHCC campus to serve students living in the West metro area. The current Metropolitan State bachelor’s degrees in nursing and business administration will continue.</p>
<p>The new programs were created in response to increasing demand for degrees at the bachelor’s and master’s levels.</p>
