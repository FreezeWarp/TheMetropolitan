<article><p>Earlier this year, I wrote about an expensive but underutilized resource called OrgSync that few students take advantage of. Writing that article got me thinking, “What other great resources does the school provide that we students may not know about?” After a little bit of research and a short talk with CWA professor Fred Carpenter, I compiled the following list of underutilized and underpublicized but nonetheless amazing student resources.</p>
<p>Also, they’re all FREE!</p>

<h2>Microsoft Office 365</h2>
<p>Thats right! As a Metro State student, you are entitled to free Microsoft Office software on your Mac or PC. I’m sure I speak for all of us when I say that this is a nearly invaluable resource for students. The suite of programs includes the ever-popular Word, Excel and PowerPoint, which would typically run you $100 or more. And it’s super easy to download. Just use the web address below and select the device you want to download the software to. You will then see download instructions that include signing into Microsoft with your StarID credentials. </p>

<p>Oh! It gets better. You can download the software on up to five computers, five tablets and five smartphones. It doesn’t get much better than that, am I right?</p>

<h2>Lynda.com</h2>
<p>Chances are that at some point during your time as a Metro State student, you’ve heard one or more of your professors mention Lynda, the online tool that provides thousands of tutorials on a very wide range of topics. Unfortunately, it’s very likely that you’ve never actually used the resource. Well, you didn’t hear it from me, but whether you need help with a class or are just blowing off schoolwork with a new hobby, Lynda likely has a tutorial for you.</p>
<p>Want to learn the fundamentals of video game design? How about technical writing? Small business finance? No matter what it is, Lynda.com probably has something to help expand your skill set. Just look up “Lynda” using the search tool on the university website and follow the prompts to create your free account. Then you can sit back and let the learning happen. </p>

<h2>Food For Thought Pantry</h2>
<p>Food for Thought is the food shelf sponsored by Metro State’s Student Parent Center in partnership with local nonprofit Good in the Hood. This is the organization’s second year at Metro State. It provides donated nonperishable food items to students free of charge Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. It’s also important to note that poor nutrition has been linked to poor academic achievement, so whether you need groceries in your fridge or something to fill your belly between classes, Food For Thought is a great resource to take advantage of. </p>
<p>That’s all for this month, but look out for future updates on free and low-cost student resources in future installments of my column. Your education isn’t cheap, so it’s important to take advantage of every resource that your tuition affords you. Besides, you work hard, and you deserve the perks.</p>
