<strong><p>Dear Dr. Kev,</p>
<p>Why don’t girls like nice guys?</p>
<p>Sincerely,<p>
<p>Nice Guys Finish Last</p></strong>


<p>Nice Guys Finish Last,</p>
<p>While you didn’t describe your particular situation, I have a vaguely Sherlockian hunch that you consider yourself a “nice guy” who has ran into a dating slump. These things happen.</p>
<p>So, I need to respond to your question with a question. First, how exactly do you define the term “nice guy”? I don’t think one blanket definition works in all situations. Plus, it’s difficult to pin down your niceness (or lack thereof) as the exact reason you’re striking out. Finally, your question assumes that half the population feels exactly the same about their dating preferences — we’ll address that later.</p>
<p>I’m going run a few scenarios up the flag pole and see if you salute one.</p>

<h2>Not So Nice</h2>
<p>When you say “nice guy,” what exactly do you picture? Extra cab-fare on the night stand? Sunday morning breakfast at Perkins (it’s just a sit-down McDonalds) followed by a long string of unanswered text messages? Post-coitus bliss cut short by a sandwich order?</p>
<p>None of these things are particularly nice (Tremendous Twelves included). If this sounds like you, then you’re not a “nice guy,” you’re an asshole. Make sure the “nice” things you are doing are in fact nice, and not things you are doing out of self-interest. Pro tip: if someone on Jersey Shore would do it, it’s probably not nice.</p>

<h2>Not Being You</h2>
<p>Does your unique brand of niceness include a certain change in personality? Or, do you have a “nice guy” routine that you put on when you see a pretty girl?</p>
<p>Quit doing that. If you have to put on an act or change your behavior to maintain someone’s attention, then I’d give that relationship about 15 minutes before both of you have had enough.</p>
<p>Instead of putting on another mask, I think you’d do better by acting like, well, you.</p>

<h2>Not the Right Crowd</h2>
<p>Maybe you are a genuinely nice person. We’ve never met, so I can’t offer an opinion on that. However, for the sake of this column, let’s assume your compliment game is on a Mr. Rogers level.</p>
<p>Who has been turning you down? Is it a small group of people you’ve known for a while?</p>
<p>If you’ve been striking out with a certain crowd, branch out. There’s plenty of ladies out there who are tired of standing outside Ubers crying. Hit the bars with some homies and see what happens.</p>

<h2>C’mon Bro</h2>
<p>On another note, women aren’t restaurant franchises: they’re people. Saying that all women don’t like nice guys is like saying that all restaurants are Taco Bell. It’s dehumanizing and inaccurate. Likewise, since the entire world isn’t collectively sitting on the toilet moaning, I’d say there are quite a few restaurants other than Taco Bell. Get back on the horse and try again; there’s a lot of women out there.</p>


<p>Hope this helps. Until next time, I remain:</p>
<p>Your Friend,</p>
<p>Dr. Kev</p>
