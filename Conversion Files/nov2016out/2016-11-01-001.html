<p>Many students are used to going to class, juggling social and family functions, and sometimes work schedules. This can leave little left of time, and money. The Twin Cities area is dripping with activities, but most of the time it is difficult for students to scrounge up funds to experience these events.</p>
<p>There are many metropolitan businesses who offer student discounts. This is a wonderful chance to experience what they have to offer without breaking the bank.</p>

<h2>Entertainment</h2>
<p>It is one of our Twin Cities’ strong suits. There are many places willing to discount the full price for a more satisfying one. A variety of events would make for an enjoyable evening out and welcome break from classes.</p>
<p>Movie theaters: A form of entertainment that has been hiking prices for some time now, making one think twice about the popcorn and oversized drink.</p>
<p>AMC theaters allow a student discount for the price of movie tickets, after 4p.m. These discounts vary per location. Roseville’s tickets start at $10.17 while tickets at Inver Grove Heights start at $9.09. Upgrades to 3D is an additional $3 at both locations.</p>
<p>The Riverview Theater in South Minneapolis is also another excellent option. While no student discount is available, it’s not necessary. With tickets costing no more than $3 at any given time, it is a great way to catch a movie with a date, family or by yourself while keeping the outing under $20.</p>
<p>Music: There are many available concerts for you to enjoy in the Twin Cities.</p>
<p>The Minnesota Orchestra gives student discounts that range from $10 to $12 per ticket bought in advance, but these tickets are priced from a case by case basis. They also offer hefty discounts on rush tickets to students. These tickets are on sale one and a half to two hours before the concerts, although there is no guarantee on what seats will be available.</p>
<p>The Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra offers their best available seats for $10, a wonderful deal for anyone. With the proof of a student ID, tickets are free. They suggest to preorder tickets for best availability.</p>
<p>Minnesota Opera at the Ordway offers students 10 percent off on Tuesday, Thursday, and Sundays rush ticket sale (available 30 minutes prior to performance).</p>
<p>Shout House—a rock ‘n roll venue with great music and comedy—is known for its Dueling Pianos act and fun daily house specials. There is no cover charge to students on Friday night, with a student ID.</p>



<h2>Museums</h2>
<p>The Science Museum of Minnesota has numerous exhibitions for all ages. They focus on their visitors learning things in fun and exciting ways. Normal admission is $12. Students are offered a discount on Fridays after 5pm, with admission into the museum costing $6; Omnitheater tickets are also $6.</p>
<p>Walker Art Institute has four floors of remarkable art galleries. Adult admission is normally $14, but a student ID allows Metro State students to enjoy these galleries for $9 a person. Thursdays, from 5-9 pm, and the first Saturday of each month are free to everyone.</p>

<h2>Food</h2>
<p>Papa John’s has delicious pizza, and offers a tasty discount for students. When shown a valid student ID, the Lexington, University and Larpenteur locations give a 20 to 30 percent discount to students.</p>
<p>Loring Pasta Bar is a lovely restaurant in the heart of Dinkytown. This is a popular restaurant for good reason. Usually pasta restaurants are more on the spendy side, but students are offered 25 percent off their meal with valid ID, except for Fridays and Saturdays.</p>

<h2>Shopping</h2>
<p>Apple Store—in-store and online—gives discounts to students, which vary depending on products purchased.</p>
<p>Microsoft gives a 10 percent discount across the board for students. They also offer a free cloud version of Microsoft Office Suite through Outlook email.</p>
