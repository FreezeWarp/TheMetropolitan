<h2>What is Healthcare and Wellness Services?</h2>
<p>During spring semester 2017, students were charged a $2.50 per credit fee for Healthcare and Wellness Services, that was approved by the Metropolitan State University Student Senate in 2014. As a result, students will be able to have access to Zipnosis, a telemedicine platform available at no cost. In addition, other health and wellness initiatives will be available to students throughout the year.</p>
